The Bitcoin Cash Podcast was very fortunate to recently complete a 29.85 BCH Flipstarter. Budget was increased a little from Flipstarter 4 to reflect the Podcast's ongoing increasing reach.

For more about Flipstarter, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the Flipstarter is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted Flipstarter subdomain (https://bchpodcastflipstarer.com/) will eventually be taken down or perhaps used for another Flipstarter.
