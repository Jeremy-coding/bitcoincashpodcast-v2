Short update today as I am super busy with everything - March looking to be the biggest 2025 month already.

## Podcast

- Episode 141, 142 released. Especially enjoyed having both Emergent & Fiendish on at the same time, group discussions always bring out new perspectives https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f-NLQta41g  We're looking likely for 3 episodes in March, you can check in on the live episode times at https://helpme.cash/events (and list your own BCH related dates & events!)
- Was able to have some good bridge building with Bitcoin Mechanic. It's nice to be finally breaking through so much of the hoaxes & disinformation about BCH to have some proper dialogue. https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1887409340883050575
- I also appeared on the Digital Cash Rundown with @thedesertlynx for the first time in a while https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v--a57hu5Yg
- Tested out a first round of "BCH Bank Run", which didn't pump the price but did get a fair amount of community exposure & engagement.  Something to build on over time, next one will be 15th March & 1st April - so set your DCAs or prep your assets to be active on that day! https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1895619994563580226

## BLISS

- Now just 72 days until BLISS! Grab your Velma NFT ticket at https://tapswap.cash/trade/5a4f6b25243c1a2dabb2434e3d9e574f65c31764ce0e7eb4127a46fa74657691
- Released our second Velma BLISS explainer video, this time on "What is BLISS?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVj8LepAPs
	- The plan is to have a series of these helping spread BCH education as they have been incredibly effective
- Background work ongoing on the event.

## Selene

- The next version of Selene, coming in the next two weeks, is better than ever. Includes CashTokens, CoinControl, massive performance upgrade & several bugfixes.
	- I have been really impressed with how far the project has come since August 2022 (now 2.5 years ago!)
	- I expect a rise in active users after the release, as with the previous one. But we'll see.
- We're preparing a full report on Selene's progress in order to request another round of Flipstarter funding, as it has now been 12 months since our last round. There will be more detail in that.

Alright that's all I have time for, keep spreading p2p cash!
