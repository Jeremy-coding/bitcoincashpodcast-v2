_Endorsed with love._

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast is excited to publically endorse the [Bitcoin Cash Foundation](https://bitcoincashfoundation.org/) & be listed on its Endorsements page. BCH is a resilient & growing project, but its success rests only on the proactive contributions & collaboration of its community. The BCHF stands out notably in this regard & it's something the entire BCH community should take seriously in recognising & rewarding. Bringing about a voluntary, decentralised world is no small task & it's one which the BCHF has undertaken with passion & dedication - leading by example in its committment & contributions.

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast supports the Bitcoin Cash Foundation in communication efforts related to BCH ecosystem news and basic outreach. Furthermore, we support the Bitcoin Cash Foundationâ€™s efforts to ensure Bitcoin Cash is represented in a manner consistent with ecosystem standards

As part of this endorsement, a new Podcast FAQ article has been added [explaining the role of The Bitcoin Cash Foundation](/faqs/Projects/what-is-the-BCH-foundation). This is important to help explain its distinctive nature from the centralising "Foundations" rife throughout the rest of cryptocurrency (plus increase BCHF visibility). It is a regrettable reality that the world is not used to interacting with properly decentralised projects (particularly cryptocurrencies) yet. In this environment it is not only preferable but absolutely essential that BCH has an organisation able to represent the community's interests where an "official" voice is required and the BCHF is doing a tremendous job in this regard.

Thank you for your work Bitcoin Cash Foundation & we look forward to our continuing collaboration in the future!

Jeremy
