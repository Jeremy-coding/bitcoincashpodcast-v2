The Bitcoin Cash Podcast was very fortunate to recently complete a 12 BCH Flipstarter on 30th July in a matter of only about 12 hours. As with the first Flipstarter, this second enthusiastic response from the community was well noted, and The Bitcoin Cash Podcast feels very gratified by the support.

For more about Flipstarter, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the Flipstarter is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted Flipstarter subdomain (https://flipstarter.bitcoincashpodcast.com/) will eventually be taken down or perhaps used for another Flipstarter.
