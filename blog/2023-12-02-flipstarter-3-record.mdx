:::

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast was very fortunate to recently complete a 35 BCH Flipstarter over a period of a couple of weeks to the end of November. After enthusiastic response to the first 2 Flipstarters, this one was significantly more ambitious. It was funded, but perhaps was shooting a little high for where the Podcast is at at this stage.

For more about Flipstarter, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the Flipstarter is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted Flipstarter subdomain (https://flipstarter.bitcoincashpodcast.com/) will eventually be taken down or perhaps used for another Flipstarter.
