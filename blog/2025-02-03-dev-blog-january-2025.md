A medium-speed start to the year.  I suffered a few days of illness that delayed early momentum, but by the end of the month things have been getting moving again at increasing speed. The BLISS ticket sale opening is the biggest milestone & February will be far more focussed on keeping up the promotion efforts. Buy a ticket, help us sell out & come have a great Bitcoin powered holiday in Slovenia in May!!

# Podcast

- New year, new BCH Podcast Intro!  Learn about the moments behind these clips here: https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/Podcast/what-are-the-intro-references#2025-intro
- Episodes 139 & 140 released. Usually we aim for 3 per month but in Jan we only got to two.  If you need more BCH content, I highly recommend the excellent work of:
	- Fiendish And Friends https://www.youtube.com/@fiendishcrypto
	- General Protocols Spaces https://www.youtube.com/@generalprotocols
- Our FundMe campaign completed, securing funding for Episodes 136 - Episode 145. As promised, 0.5 BCH was spent to purchase & burn 27,900 BADGER as Proof Of Goodwill (PoG) - 939e57c000897cda778f0f1e89a5ca2d15bc8bd07543547680f2f5047878bef9. https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1873022065223053546

- VM Limits upgrade explainer video released (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOIzAcCap6A), has been just as popular as its predecessor the ABLA video
- The success of explainer videos means we will likely do more of those educational/promotional crossover style explainers in future

# Selene

- Both Kallisti and I suffered some illness that has delayed things a little
- Still nicely around the 100 daily users, 800 monthly users mark.  Obviously growth would be preferable, but marketing is not a focus so much as taking the app feature set & engagement from existing users up another level or two
- Looking for a next release in February, which will include the long-promised CashTokens support (!!), basic version to start and will be iterated
- We're also preparing for a FundMe/Flipstarter, our last one was in March 2024 & we're approaching the specified 1 year timeline
	- We delivered on most of our targets, and will have some notes about the edges where we didn't quite get there
	- More details to come but most likely we're going to do a 6 month pitch this time around, with our thinking on how we can accelerate Selene in the short term & look to have an even bigger plan for 2026 in December

2025 is going to be an absolutely massive year for BCH, we'll have to set a scorching pace to outperform 2024 but I'm feeling very optimistic and I've never worked harder than I am at the moment.
