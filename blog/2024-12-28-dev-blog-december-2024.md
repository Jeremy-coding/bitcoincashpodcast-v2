A predictably quieter month. December is always going to be a slow month - both myself & the rest of the Podcast team slow things down particularly at the end of the month, have a break to reflect & spend some time with family. That's in general effect throughout BCH & the world at large - it's important to have a proper rest sometimes! Just a short update today.

## BCH Podcast

- Episodes 136 - 138 released, including the extended Christmas episode!  Great listen for your end of year break time. Catch them here: https://www.youtube.com/@BitcoinCashPodcast
- Released a new FundMe (currently 84% funded), needs 3 more BCH to fuel the rest of the episodes to #145. If you're enjoying the show, consider chipping in! https://fundme.cash/campaign/18
- The Podcast has now passed 2 500 Youtube subscribers & growing very consistently.

## BLISS - @bchbliss

- Around 4000 FURU was airdropped to Jessica holders, testing out our new airdrop tool (maybe more to come there, hint hint)
- Preparation work behind the scenes for BLISS 2025 so we can ramp up our marketing efforts in the new year.
- Ticket sale begins 15th January! Mark it in your calendar, we're targeting to sell out our 100 tickets & will consider expanding the event if we do!

## Selene - @SeleneWallet

- Lots of updates given by Kallisti on BCH Podcast Episode 138! Take a listen!
CashTokens & Coin Control the next immediate items on the roadmap
Last month's upgrade went smoothly, some users had to rebuild in isolated cases but otherwise no problems
- Active users is just constantly growing & growing, we're finishing the year with nearly 2 000 active users for this year (counting from June).  Expecting to massively exceed this in 2025.
- We have some (UNFINISHED!!) documentation to help people onboard & resolve issues now live at: https://docs.selene.cash/docs/intro


## Other news

I have been reflecting on what has been most effective for attracting new BCH adopters recently.  We should try to hone in on & amplify those features in 2025.  The top answers seem to be:
1. Vision & philosophy as p2p cash
2. Usage as p2p cash
3. Learning about the Bitcoin Hijacking
4. Improving BCH confidence & momentum

Something for us all to think about.

Merry Christmas & happy New Year!  See you all in 2025.
