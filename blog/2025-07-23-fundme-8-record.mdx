:::

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast recently completed its 8th round of funding, having switched from Flipstarter as with previous campaigns to the new easier-to-use & exciting [FundMe.cash](https://fundme.cash) tech (thanks Sayoshi Nakamario!).

For more about BCH Fundraising, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the FundMe campaign is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted FundMe url (https://fundme.cash/campaign/25) may eventually go stale.
