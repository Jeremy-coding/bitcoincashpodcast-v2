I've been super inspired by the great monthly dev blog of A Fifth Of Gaming https://www.reddit.com/r/afog/ as a method for distributing news on the project & performing some public accountability, so I'm starting to also write a quick monthly summary of what I've been involved in.

This will help me stay on track as well as serve as a bit of a news bulletin & reminder for anything my audience might have missed the first time around.
## BCH Podcast
- Released episode 133 & filmed & released episodes 134 & 135.  All available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@BitcoinCashPodcast/videos
- Wrote my first monthly accountability post, you're reading it!
- The next Podcast FundMe will be starting this month as we've delivered on our last batch
- Plan is to have 3 Podcast episodes in December, including the regular Christmas episode & then we're done for the year!
## BLISS
- BLISS 2025 announced!  13-15th May in Ljubljana like last year. Announcement video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_oZaR9A1Q
	- Upgrading from 2 days to 3 days to fit in even more BCH action
	- Targeting the same initial 100 ticket release, but capacity to raise that if event is exceedingly popular which may happen due to massive community growth
- Ticket sale starts: Jan 15th
- We've also got a special surprise coming for Jessica holders on Friday! Ensure you have your Jessica held self-custodially on a P2PKH address (a regular q or z address) instead of on TapSwap or elsewhere to be part of it! https://x.com/bchbliss/status/1863640447970681336
- Team has been working behind the scenes to get everything ready. Probably not too many updates to come between now & January but then a lot will be happening
## Selene
- After some delays for various reasons, a new release of Selene is live in November for the first time since July
	- Lots of bugfixes & performance improvements, Selene should be noticeably faster & smoother overall
	- We added much-requested support Stamps.cash thanks to some contributions from Jim Hamill!
	- Full list of changes: https://git.xulu.tech/selene.cash/selene-wallet/-/milestones/36
- In December work is starting on the CashTokens integration, which is a big leap forward.
	- December roadmap issues are here: https://git.xulu.tech/selene.cash/selene-wallet/-/milestones/37#tab-issues
- Selene is hitting new ATHs in Daily Active Users regularly, the latest high watermark at 145 this week with over 100 users basically every day.
	- We're targeting 1 000 daily active users by end of Q1 2025
- Work has begun on some better Selene documentation & user support
- If you enable either Prerelease or Experimental mode (do so at your own risk and forgive us any bugs or ugly UI!) by going into the Credits page (tap the version number at the bottom of Settings) and tapping 7 times rapidly on the Selene logo at the top, you can get a look into what is coming in the future with an expanded Explore page (helping users experience everything BCH has to offer) and an Assets tab (with full coin control & visibility, soon to host CashTokens & other advanced features)
## Other
- Appeared twice on Fiendish's new Friday Twitter Space series Fiendish & Friends! The first 3 episodes have all been excellent, highly recommended to anyone in the BCH scene, I've been particularly enjoying his different interview style to mine. Best intentions to keep episodes to a quick 1 hour are already being tested!  All episodes available here: https://www.youtube.com/@fiendishcrypto
- Also, recommended to everyone to check out Cheap Lightning's FundMe campaign - a very deserving recipient: https://fundme.cash/campaign/17
- Got loads of traction with my favourite fresh meme creation of the month. Zero surprise this kind of thing is resonating at the moment! https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1861895373951737994
