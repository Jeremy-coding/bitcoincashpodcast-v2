:::

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast was very fortunate to recently complete a 24 BCH BCH Flipstarter over a period of a couple of weeks to the 9th of March. After running a little close to the line on the 3rd Flipstarter it was moderated a little more to stay in line with community enthusiasm for the Podcast's stage of growth.

For more about Flipstarter, check out the [FAQ article](/faqs/Tech/what-is-flipstarter).

In the spirit of accountability and transparency, a record of the Flipstarter is preserved here - for later reference of donators and to demonstrate credibility of & delivery by The Bitcoin Cash Podcast. The original hosted Flipstarter subdomain (https://flipstarter.bitcoincashpodcast.com/) will eventually be taken down or perhaps used for another Flipstarter.
