## Other BCH projects

These projects have their own funding methods &/or Flipstarters, with their own separate compensation, plus of course their own contributors & team but they are mentioned to underscore how much time & effort from The BCH Podcast goes into BCH projects.

### Selene

### Shadow Wizards

- Started the [Shadow Wizards](https://twitter.com/Shadow__Wizards) Twitter account to track BCH DeFi upgrades & maybe begin a BCH technical/cultural upgrade path for people enjoying the infamous [BTC Taproot Wizards](https://twitter.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1670839312827531279). A Shadow Wizards stream was also done although getting it published is still on the TODO list, more possible on this front after that.
