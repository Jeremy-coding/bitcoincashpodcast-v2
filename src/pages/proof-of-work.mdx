## Other BCH projects

These projects have their own funding methods &/or Flipstarters, with their own separate compensation, plus of course their own contributors & team but they are mentioned to underscore how much time & effort from The BCH Podcast goes into BCH projects.

### Selene

- Founding & ongoing contributions to [Selene Wallet](https://selene.cash).

### BCH BLISS

- Part of the organising & promotional team for [BCH BLISS](https://www.bliss.cash). Jessica NFT creator.

### A Fifth Of Gaming

- For more context on this see [Episode 94 with AFoG’s creator David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yadskoNfbwI) and the [inaugural Power Overwhelming finals stream of myself vs Kallisti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfZtHSHNTPc).

Previously running the [Starcraft 2 Power Overwhelming guild](https://afifthofgaming.com/Guild/Detail/18) on A Fifth of Gaming, now contributing to other guilds/events as time allows.

### Shadow Wizards

- Started the [Shadow Wizards](https://twitter.com/Shadow__Wizards) Twitter account to track BCH DeFi upgrades & maybe begin a BCH technical/cultural upgrade path for people enjoying the infamous [BTC Taproot Wizards](https://twitter.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1670839312827531279). A Shadow Wizards stream was also done although getting it published is still on the TODO list, more possible on this front after that.
