# Music

Not everyone has 20 hours to listen to a podcast in detail, but most people can handle a 3 minute song. To reach the billions of people necessary with the ideas of Bitcoin Cash, I have started creating songs explaining the project.

Music can be a good adoption strategy as it is:

- Succint
- Entertaining
- Accessible
- Easy to distribute
- High [proof of passion](/docs/13) (hard to ignore)
- Inspiring (uplifting in low momentum or motivation moments)

### Inspiration

Based on the original chord progression, song structure and hook of the 2015 hit [Loyal by Chris Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXRN_LkCa_o).

My favourite genres are rock and rap, and this track combines the inherent aggression of each. Maybe offputting to some, but can't please everyone.

Every good cultural movement needs a protest song, so this was my attempt for BCH.

### Lyrics

```
It’s DeFi baby
We’re coming for you banks

I wasn’t born last night
I know that money ain’t right
But I was coding up the future last night
And you were busy hating with your stupid friends online
That the Federal Reserve
Stealing pay checks straight outta your purse
Today they got a dollar
Tomorrow got nine
Your savings are in dollars
And your value in decline
Google it
Knowing Federal Reserve
Printer going brrrrrrrrrr
But it seems that you ain’t heard
Nervous?
Cash in the bank
Now where you think it goes?
You stupid little fuck
You trust the government shows?

While the rich banks rob ya
Robbin’ you blind man
Future dollars can’t buy nothing for ya
You’ve heard of inflation, right?
Banks fucked you royal
Had fun at the bank recently?
So why you loyal?
Real talk

Time to crypto switch
Crypto switch
That’s BCH bitch
BCH bitch
Dollars keep the bankers rich
Bankers rich
It’s on you to choose which
Yup
Get a phone wallet
Buy a few bits
Go out and pay for shit with it
Things change, think of marijuana
Smoke
GameStop stock, same as that brah
Online, buy drugs
Buy drugs
No guns, no thugs
No no thugs
You living in a money trap
Get yourself a crypto app
Wallet

While the rich banks rob ya
Rob you babe
Future dollars can’t buy nothing for ya
Nothing oooh
Banks fucked you royal
Oooooh no
So why you loyal?
Yeah yeah

Young girl with her student debt
Fuck
Nothing paid yet
Get into it, by the way
Bankers up in this Wharf printing more dollars
I know girl
That you’re not an expert in finance
That’s a no-no girl
Endless money from thin air
You never stood a chance
No chance
Join the crypto switch
Just switch
That’s BCH bitch
Sup bitch
Dollars keep the bankers rich
So rich
It’s on you to choose which
Yup

While the rich banks rob ya
Rob you babe
Future dollars can’t buy nothing for ya
No nothing, oooooh
Banks fucked you royal
State sponsored criminal enterprise
So why you loyal?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fraud got bigger
Crypto got slicker
Banks got sicker
Bail outs got bigger
You staying poor while banks are getting richer
System is rigged
Starting to get the picture?
Me and LD here to trade with ya
Peer-to-peer crypto can save ya
Ok
Let’s talk about these coins that I’m carrying
Bitcoin Cash like I’m a fucking finance heretic,
Shout out Roger Ver
Cold wallets unspent
Earn crypto, price check
Shit you know you got regret
Fees so high no one trades with it
Miss me with that orange Bitcoin
Shit

This ain’t a rap for the blind, deaf, dumb
It’s a plea to my mum
There’s a reason the world’s forever in debt
Take your savings and run
Open your ears, please don’t stay numb
Crypto’s easy and fun
Banks leech your savings every single day
’Til the value is none

While rich banks rob ya
Earning dollars ain’t got no future for ya
Banks fucked you royal
Go get disloyal
While rich banks rob ya
Saving dollars ain’t got no future for ya
Banks fucked you royal
Go get D1$L0YAL

Satoshi Nakamoto gave humanity a miraculous gift
A chance to be free of the banking system, forever
Now’s our shot
Let’s take it
Shout out to Marc de Mesel
Satoshi’s Angels
Full node devs
bitcoincashpodcast.com
Yeah fuck the banks man
BCH Gang
Peace
