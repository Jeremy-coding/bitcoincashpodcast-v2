For community projects, check out the [roadmap](/roadmap).

All of the following creators and resources are highly recommended:

## Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](/bitcoin.pdf)

Published on October 31st 2008, the Bitcoin whitepaper is the original explanation and design specification for the currency by (anonymous, and inactive since 2011) creator Satoshi Nakamoto. It is technical, but only 9 pages (including pictures!) and worth reading to understand Bitcoin directly from its progenitor.

Note that the original Bitcon community (starting in 2009) split into the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) communities on August 1st 2017. The original community could not agree on the direction of the project, and as there is no one in charge of Bitcoin who could decide the debate, the two groups split the original Bitcoin into two competing versions of Bitcoin (called "forks"). The Bitcoin Cash community was determined to maintain the original design and mission specified in the whitepaper - a peer-to-peer electronic cash system - while the Bitcoin BTC community decided instead to become "digital gold".

Bitcoin was created to provide an alternative to the US Federal Reserve banking system, which silently profits off the labour of the entire world's population. This is a great explanation of the system, and demonstrates the need for an independent currency.

Watch the BCH and BTC blockchain transactions live, seen as passengers boarding a bus.

Chat to the BCH community.
