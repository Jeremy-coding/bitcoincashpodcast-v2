  NOTE: This Roadmap is largely unattended.  See the <a href="/faqs/Decentralisation/does-BCH-have-a-roadmap" target="_blank">FAQ on Roadmaps</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Why?</b> The world needs neutral, inflation-free, censorship-resistant
  money to create global access to an inclusive, unbiased financial system and
  prosperity.
