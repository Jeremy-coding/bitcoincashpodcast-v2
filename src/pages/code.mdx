# Code

Bitcoin Cash is a social movement, but it's also a technical project. The code that runs Bitcoin Cash nodes and miners is all open source, as are many BCH wallets and community tools, which means the full program is available for free for anyone to review, download, copy or submit updates.

Because the code is available to everyone, it is:

- Freely available
- Auditable for security issues
- Open to innovation by anyone, either as a submitted update or by starting a spin-off and making modifications

For the same reasons, the entire source code for this website is available to the entire world. Anyone can submit an update, or create their own copy and modify it as they please.

Contributions (pull requests and suggestions) are always welcome from the community!

A lot of good BCH developer resources can be found through the collection at [Bitcoin Cash.site](https://bitcoincashsite.com/build/)

To get involved more in Bitcoin Cash development in general, check out [Bitcoin Cash Network Discussions](https://bitcoincashnetworkdiscussions.org/), [Bitcoin Cash Research](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/) and [SmartBch.org](https://smartbch.org/)!
BCH always needs more engineers, and there's lots of opportunities available in the scene with everything from wallet dev, dApps, nodes, mining, supporting services and more.
