# Build

Bitcoin Cash is a leaderless project that (along with other cryptocurrencies) is discovering new ground in voluntary systems of human cooperation.

To assist in facilitating voluntary co-operation in the ecosystem, The Bitcoin Cash Podcast hosts a series called "BCH Builders". These sessions complement the podcast episodes (focussed on news, education and community engagement) with a separate track for ecosystem development and engineering.
