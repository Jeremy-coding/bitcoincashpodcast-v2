# Memes

A collection of some of my favourite memes.

Much discussion & debate (particularly with [misinformed BTC adopters](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc)) across various online platforms tends to retread the same patterns of discussion over & over again. These memes are a simple, concise, engaging, funny & decisive way to refute these tired arguments or point out opponent's hypocrisy, poor debating or misunderstanding in a way that is likely to connect with & convince observers.

Apply liberally!
