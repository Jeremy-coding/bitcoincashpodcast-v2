# Memes

A collection of some of my favourite memes.

Much discussion & debate (particularly with [misinformed BTC adopters](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc)) across various online platforms tends to retread the same patterns of discussion over & over again. These memes are a simple, concise, engaging, funny & decisive way to refute these tired arguments or point out opponent's hypocrisy, poor debating or misunderstanding in a way that is likely to connect with & convince observers.

You can search a keyword on the page to see if it matches any descriptions.

Apply liberally!

## General purpose

<img src={splitBitcoin} alt="Meme" />

_2013 vs 2023 Bitcoin. Narrative shift & split simply explained._

<img src={dogeChess} alt="Doge chess" />

_Doge plays chess, just like BCH Twitter playing BTC Twitter._

<img src={selfInflicted} alt="self inflicted" />

_The self inflicted wound of putting a stick in your own bike. Classic BTC._

<img src={balloonMeme} alt="Meme" />

_Store of Value is a total lie._

<img src={BitcoinMorpheus} alt="Meme" />

_Bitcoin Morpheus offers a choice of the orange pill BTC or green pill BCH._

<img src={bcasherLeo} alt="Meme" />

_Leonardo di Caprio spots a bcasher. Useful for BTC people expressing exact BCH sentiment._

<img src={bchpls} alt="BCH PLS" />

_BCH PLS. Attention grabber in comment sections._

<img src={choseSalty} alt="Chose salty" />

_All these flavours and you chose to be salty. Not BCH specific, but a useful classic._

<img src={bankers} alt="Blockstream bankers" />

_Blockstream is a banker funded operation._

## BCash is dead

<img src={angrynpc} alt="Angry NPC" />

_Angry NPC tries to claim bcash is dead for the millionth time in a row._

<img src={btrashDead} alt="btrashDead" />

_Bcash btrash BCH is dead, mum they're telling us again._

<img src={bchisdeadscreaming} alt="bch is dead" />

_BCH bcash is dead alternative._

## Specific individuals

Meme worthy individuals that have dug their own grave.

### Adam Back

<img src={adamBackMeme} alt="Meme" />

_Adam Back - Frustrated year after year that gaslighting the BCH community never works._

### Eric Wall

<img src={ericWall} alt="Meme" />

_Eric Wall - smarter than all the laser eye stupid people he used to be in agreement with._

### John Carvalho

<img src={johnCarvalho} alt="Meme" />

_John Carvalho - how the turn tables, powerless to fix Bitcoin or his own cognitive dissonance._

### Paul Sztorc

<img src={paulSztorc} alt="Meme" />

_Paul Sztorc - great guy, but unfortunately can't see that the network effect of BTC he values so highly is the network effect preventing any progress._
