# FAQs

import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin Cash is an immensely deep topic. However, like anything, there are some questions which almost everyone wonders about at one time or another. This is a collection of answers that are short enough to digest quickly, but long enough to encapsulate a complete idea.

Note: Although the FAQs stand alone, the [Start Guide](/start) and the Youtube documentary ["Who Killed Bitcoin?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc) are heavily recommended as foundational knowledge and background.

## SmartBCH (sBCH)

:::danger

SmartBCH assets are currently under seizure by an insolvent CoinFlex. This is a complicated situation, detailed breakdown can be found in [Episode 52](/docs/52) and [Episode 53](/docs/53). Recent updates on [Episode 60](/docs/60).

It is critically important to research SmartBCH and understand the risks thoroughly before using it in any capacity at this time. Further updates will of course appear on the podcast where notable change has happened, but The Bitcoin Cash Podcast suggests avoiding SmartBCH entirely at this time.
