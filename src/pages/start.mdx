# Bitcoin For Beginners

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Jeremy and I absolutely love Bitcoin. In 2013, a friend mentioned the word Bitcoin to me and I have been obsessed with it ever since.

At the time, talking about Bitcoin was seen as fringe and possibly a little crazy. But as time has passed, Bitcoin has proven to the world that it is a robust and valuable innovation. It has pioneered the cryptocurrency industry, which has grown from nothing to more than a trillion dollars in about 12 years, roughly half the time it took Google to reach the same size. It has legions of avid supporters and just as many vocal critics. It has inspired documentaries, books, artwork, music and everything else imaginable.

However, despite its prominence, Bitcoin is still very commonly misunderstood. People are bewildered by a constant stream of hyperbolic headlines, scams, misinformation, price volatility, new cryptocurrencies, mixed messages from companies, governments or banks and much more besides. It's hard to make heads or tails of what any of this is about, yet it seems like the world is rushing towards it at an incredible pace.

That's what I'm here to fix. To solve this problem I created this video series - Bitcoin for Beginners. It's a series of 10 short episodes, 5 minutes each, so that in under 1 hour you can properly understand what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is all about. There is no prior knowledge required, and I promise that if you watch it from start to finish you will feel much more confident in your own research or the next time cryptocurrency is mentioned at an office party. It's broken up into chunks so you can take it step-by-step or watch it all at once, and it should be easy to revisit each piece as many times as you need to. There is a lot to think about, and cryptocurrency is not going anywhere between today and tomorrow so don't rush and take it at your own pace.

Here is the breakdown of the episodes:

1. [Money](/start#episode-1-of-10-money)
2. Bitcoin
3. Philosophy
4. Adoption
5. Banks
6. Government
7. Finance
8. Bitcoin Cash
9. Ethereum, Dogecoin etc.
10. The future

We'll start by talking about the history of money, how Bitcoin fits into the story, how it works and why it came about. Next is how cryptocurrency has grown, how this has been handled by government and banks, and the general market mania around cryptocurrency. Then we'll look at how cryptocurrency has grown beyond Bitcoin with Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other types of coins. And finally, we'll talk about the future and why cryptocurrency is set to change the way people organise themselves in society.

Before we get started, 1 quick disclaimer.

I am not a professional financial advisor, this is not investment advice blah blah blah. Don't worry, I'm not here to tell you about getting rich. What I will do is my absolute best to demistify all of the volatility and speculation that goes on in cryptocurrency, so you can see the forest for the trees. In cryptocurrency, people often say "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose", but I prefer to say "Don't invest more than you can understand." Everybody's financial situation is different, but if you know what cryptocurrency is about and how it works, you will be able to make the best decisions for yourself - whether that is completely avoiding cryptocurrency or changing your entire career to join the industry or anything in between, the best choice is different for everyone.

Alright, that's it, I hope you enjoy this series, welcome to Bitcoin for Beginners and I'm glad you're along for the ride. I'll see you in Episode 1 to talk about the thing that makes the world go round: MONEY.

## Episode 1 of 10: Money

// Naughty By Nature: Here Comes The Money

They say it makes the world go round, doesn't grow on trees and it can't buy happiness. Wars have been fought over it, business empires built, lives wasted and nations destroyed. Some people are good with it, and some never have enough. Almost everyone uses money every single day, and yet its existence is generally taken entirely for granted. Education about our financial system is suspiciously absent from schools, universities, the media and even places you think it would be well understood such as banks or Economics think tanks. If nothing else, public consternation over Bitcoin is undeniable proof that the world is not much used to thinking about money, and contains a lot of hidden assumptions that are surprising or confronting when brought to the surface.

When you think of money, you probably think of something like this, a physical paper or polymer note issued by your local government and maybe metallic coins for small denominations. You know you can work for more of it, and trade it with other people for things you need. But if pressed, it might be hard to provide a rational reason for why pieces of paper are worth trading valuable time and skilled labour for except that everyone else is doing it or that's just the way it's always been.

Of course, that's not the way it's always been. Throughout human history, people have used all kinds of things to trade as money. Seashells, beads, salt, gold and silver, sheep and cattle, poker chips, trading cards, even large unmovable rocks. Famously cigarettes have been used as money in prisons or during war time, and video games or science fiction movies may have a variety of commodities or credit systems in use. You may operate an informal bar tab arrangement with your friends or family that is rarely if ever settled in cash, or unquestioningly accept an entirely different system of money when playing a game of Monopoly or travelling to another country.

It's very apparent, that given the right circumstances or environment, anything can be traded for anything. But a freeform system of barter is heavily impractical, as matching goods in exactly tradeable quantities is difficult to do without a common reference point. Therefore any human collective will naturally and rapidly adopt a central good as its most tradeable commodity to facilitate commerce. The choice of goods is not random though, and highly prioritises items with the best mix of the following 6 attributes:

1. **Scarcity**: Money needs to be limited in supply. The reason we don't use blades of grass as money is that if anyone can have as much money as they want, then it is fundamentally worthless. If the government gave every single person 100 trillion dollars tomorrow, that wouldn't make everyone rich or increase the amount of goods available to buy - it would just make money worth a lot less. The exact quantity of money is not important, just the general premise that it has a limit on supply, and therefore can be trusted to retain value.

2. **Portability**: Money has to be easy to transport, in small or large quantities. Concrete bricks are a terrible kind of money because it's hard to carry to the store to buy your coffee.

3. **Durability**: Money needs to last throughout time. We can't use bananas as money, because the banana you have today will be going bad in just a couple of days, and rot away completely within a few weeks let alone a year, so it won't preserve your purchasing power very well. Money also needs to survive wear and tear, because it is always being handed around. This is why metal coins are often used and not glass or plastic, they hold up better to the rigours of being passed around, dropped, clattered together or rained on.

4. **Divisibility**: Money has to support easy subdivision and combination. A system of barter is not sustainable because it is hard to trade two and a half chickens for three quarters of a pig. If money is going to be used to facilitate trade, it has to be easy to divide into smaller quantities and just as easy to recombine into larger amounts as transactions demand.

5. **Fungibility**: Related to divisibility, money needs to be uniform and regular. Watercolour paintings are terrible things to use as money, because one Van Gogh painting is completely different from a Picasso painting, or even from another Van Gogh painting. In contrast, one bar of gold is much the same as any other bar of gold that weighs the same, or one $5 note pretty much equivalent to any other $5 note - other people will not quibble about receiving one specific note or the other in commerce, a $5 note is a $5 note.

6. **Recognisability**: Related to scarcity, money has to be easy to identify. If someone can make a fake dollar bill on their home printer and spend it at the store without being detected, before too long they will have printed themselves enough money to buy whatever they want and simultaneously made everyone else's money worth a lot less. Therefore money needs to be easily verifiable by each individual as they are trading for it, to avoid the proliferation of counterfeiting scams that debase money supply and unfairly reward counterfeiters.

Think about those attributes and the examples of money from the start of the episode. Then head along to the next episode, where we get to the main attraction: Bitcoin.

## Episode 2 of 10: Bitcoin

Ok, now we know what characteristics define a good item for money, we can turn to the main game: Bitcoin.

For many years, cryptography experts and free market thinkers have pondered the possibility of making a form of electronic money. By default, electronic money would be very portable, divisible, fungible and recognisable and durable - since it would consist only of signals over the internet. However, the stumbling block was the first and most important aspect of money - scarcity. Making a digital money was not possible, because anyone who had a small amount of it could copy-and-paste it a billion times to make themselves more of it, and since anyone could do that it would soon become worthless.

The solution is to have someone in charge of verifying the supply - such as a government, bank or company. This is how your online banking works. The problem with that is that it gives the bank control of the system, and they can increase or decrease the supply, reverse transactions or delete your money at their own discretion. Maybe those systems can work to some extent, but in a politically divided world it's impossible for everyone to agree on a system where one person has all the power.

But until Bitcoin, it was not known how to have a thing that was limited in supply, without being monitored and verified by a single party.

~~ This changed in 2008, when the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper online. His paper, titled "Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system" detailed the technical specification for a group of people to run a currency online where no central party was in control, with no need for the people involved to trust each other or even to know who they were dealing with, and with no-one in the system able to cheat and print themselves free Bitcoin.

This is the real reason Bitcoin is important is that it is the invention of **digital scarcity**, the first kind of electronic or Internet object which could not be copy-pasted to make more of it.

Satoshi's solution to having one party control the record of accounts, was to give EVERYONE the record of accounts - so that naturally in a group of 100 people, 99 of them will disagree with any 1 person giving themselves some free Bitcoin. And to prove that the ledger maintainers were serious about their investment in the system, they were required to put their own money on the line in a way that could not be faked - by spending electricity. Since humanity only has a limited supply of energy, and getting it is costly, cryptographically proven expenditure of energy is as close as humanity has to a universal resource. This process of network participants demonstrating their sincerity through unfakeable signals (expended energy) is called Bitcoin mining.

## Episode 3 of 10: Philosophy

In and of itself, Bitcoin has no political ideology - in the same way the wheel, the internet or the tennis shoe have no agenda, they are simply useful pieces of technology available to anyone who needs them. That said, Bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto and its early community advocated a very specific set of principles and beliefs, which contributed heavily to its success and remain essential to understanding cryptocurrency to this day.

In a word, this philosophy is probably best described as "crypto-anarchy" but many early Bitcoiners will variously describe themselves as voluntaryists, anarcho-capitalists or libertarians. The foundational principles of these schools of though include:

- **Individual rights**: ~. Cryptocurrency communities generally contain a high level of suspicion of government, . One of the earliest use cases for cryptocurrency was to send money to journalist Julian Assange, after his other donations methods were shut down by the government. Crypto communities also usually view with suspicion any kind of collectivist activity, preferring to bet on the "invisible hand of the market" to guide individuals to optimal decision making. This does not mean charity or co-operation is frowned upon, actually those are both very prevalent in the cryptocurrency community, but it does mean they only operate entirely voluntarily and sometimes anonymously, without the need for external validation-seeking signalling.
- **Free-market commerce**: ~ Cryptocurrency is built on the idea of voluntary exchange creating prosperity for both parties, since if it didn't they wouldn't agree to trade! In other words, a very pure, unregulated, form of free-market capitalism. Therefore crypto communities are largely against the interference of government authorities, who are generlly seen as a hinderance backed by a violent military that runs counter to the philosophy of voluntary exchange, with no violent coercion, embedded within cryptocurrency.
- **Censorship resistance**: ~ Just as Bitcoiners believe in a free market of trade, so too they believe in a free market of ideas. For a free market of ideas, it is critical that individuals cannot be "deplatformed" for holding contrarian or fringe views. This is particularly pertinent as Bitcoin itself started as just such a fringe movement. Supression of free speech at the extreme leads to a dystopia of the kind famously enunciated in George Orwell's book 1984, and even the harshest words cannot cause physical harm, maintaining consistency with the focus on peace and lack of violence.
- **Peaceful co-operation**: ~ Combined with strong anonymity across a non-physical medium (i.e. internet communication), violent coercion is not merely impractical but literally impossible. This guarantees any trade must occur in a free market, the protection of individual rights. It also naturally explains the distrust of government, who fundamentally rely on the threat of force (via a military or police force) to collect taxation or enforce any other rules or regulations.
- **Privacy**: ~. Satoshi Nakamoto maintained total anonymity until his disappearance in 2011, and not without good reason. Founders of other non-governmental monetary systems in the 1990s and 2000s such as e-gold and Liberty Reserve found themselves regularly afoul of the law and prosecuted or jailed simply for offering alternatives to government fiat currencies. In this tradition, many cryptocurrency communities contain prominent members that are only known pseudonymously, allowing their ideas or contributions to stand solely by their merits rather than by reference to their source while simultaneously protecting the individuals from government or adversarial interference.
- **Obsolescence of Trust**: Often said as "Verify, don't trust", Bitcoiners prefer to create systems where mathematical certainty can underlie a system instead of the perpetually unreliable promise of an individual or group.

These ideals are important to understanding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency not merely as an economic advancement, but as a humanitarian social revolution creating a more free, peaceful, voluntary society. The ideological and economic aspects of Bitcoin form a virtuous cycle - Bitcoin succeeds by adhereing to its founding princples, and by succeeding it draws increased freedom and economic resources to those who support it most passionately, giving them increased capability to continue moving the movement forward.

It is important to note that critics do not need to agree with the Bitcoin community's philosophy to find the financial network itself economically useful and thus spread its influence. The Bitcoin community also welcomes any competition for ~~, hence the proliferation of thousands of alternatives. If critics have the idea and passion for a better economic system then all they have to do is prove it! Critics are even given a head start because all the software for Bitcoin is freely available online, and they are free to modify it in whichever way they like (for example, they could create a variant with mandatory taxation, highly antiethical to Bitcoiners) but would need to demonstrate its superiority by peacefully convincing more people to hold and adopt that coin than hold Bitcoin itself. To date, no other coin community has successfully taken the #1 crypto position from Bitcoin, but not for lack of trying and not without some progress towards success. Bitcoin's market share has declined from its original 100% to just 40% of the cryptocurrency market (its closest competitor, Ethereum, has risen to 20% share).

## x: banks

## x: governments

Just as any rivals to Bitcoin are welcome to start a competing coin and prove their superiority, so are governments. Despite their enormous head start, government fiat (paper) currencies have struggled to keep up (rising cryptocurrency market value is the same thing as declining fiat currency market value). A government could start its own variant of Bitcoin, but are unlikely to find widespread public support for a coin that takes purchasing power or control away from end users to give to the government, as each individual user can see it is in their own interests to avoid such a coin and instead buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

In addition, even the largest government cannot hope to compete with a permissionless global community developing products and services for their favourite cryptocurrencies in the same way that a segregated "national Internet" by even the largest countries is far inferior to the globally connected Internet.

In this way government, no matter its access to or propensity for violence, has been placed between a rock and a hard place by cryptocurrency. Supporting it will undermine what control of the monetary system they still have, and yet outcompeting it is not a feasible alternative. Bans or other punitive measures on their own citizens are also not practical - besides being unpopular with the public, it simply drives economic innovation and industrial progress into more permissive rival countries. Furthermore, government officials and legislators themselves cannot long avoid the opportunity to be involved in cryptocurrency for the sake of their own finances, and are thus tempted into advocating for cryptocurrency to protect their own investments.

Government has met its match with cryptocurrency - a completely peaceful adversary that it cannot threaten, bribe, bomb, ignore, cover-up or switch off. This will fundamentally change world history, as without the ability to invisibly tax its populations by inflating the monetary supply, government will have to adjust its expenditures to a level that can be justified with direct taxation.

## Episode 8 of 10: Bitcoin Cash

After its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin immediately became a smash hit. Despite the misinformation or doubts of its endless critics, the Bitcoin network exploded in popularity. More mining computers joined the network, transactions took off, and the project attracted interested computer enthusiasts, free market libertarians and black or grey market vendors in droves.

## Episode 9 of 10: Ethereum, Dogecoin and others

Ok so Bitcoin has proven itself in the market, and once that happened people started asking themselves "But what if I changed something?" What if I made a coin with a larger supply, faster transactions, inbuilt taxation, more privacy or something entirely new? Well the Bitcoin source code is freely available to anyone in the world, so people started experimenting. Today there are more than 10 000 cryptocurrencies available on the market place, each with their own twist on the original Bitcoin formula. You can even start your own cryptocurrency if you like, although most people will not as we will see in a moment. "This is great!" I can already hear you thinking, "I'll start my own Bitcoin and get rich!" Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. Making a new cryptocurrency is easy because you can do that on your own, the hard part is what comes next - convincing other people to trade it with you. So let's take a second to talk about that.

The only thing money is useful for is buying stuff, and the only place to get that stuff is other people. If you think back to episode 1, we talked about the six properties of money - scarcity, ~~. History has shown that people gravitate to those six characteristics of money in deciding what to trade, but they are not fundamentally required for a system of money to exist. If your friend will allow you to loan money off them, it doesn't matter if the money exists purely inside both of your heads, it has value just because you both mutually agree on the transaction.

This is where the true power of cryptocurrency lies, with you. Now that you understand about cryptocurrency, it is up to you to make the free and voluntary choice of which cryptocurrencies you will accept as payment. It could be one, several, all of them or none at all, it's totally up to you. As billions of people around the world make the same decision for themselves, the most popular coins will rise to the top and become traded just as most people trade government fiat currency today.
