title: Where and how can I get Bitcoin Cash?
---

There are three ways to acquire Bitcoin Cash:

1. **Mine BCH (not recommended)**: These days, mining is a specialised industry with thousands of machines run in specialised data centers so mining BCH is not feasible for individual investors - it would cost more electricity to mine the coins than the value of the coins themselves, and therefore the two alternatives below are more effective and efficient at acquiring BCH.
2. **Buy BCH**:. Just like any other crypto or fiat currency, BCH coins can be purchased using any other currency. Individuals will need to research their local options for exchange by searching the internet for `Cryptocurrency exchange BCH --your location--` or asking a cryptocurrency friend. BCH is one of the largest and oldest cryptocurrencies, and will be available in 99% of places that sell Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies.
3. **Earn BCH (recommended)**: The best method to acquire BCH is the same as any other kind of money, earn it directly! Employees at a business can request to have part or all of their salary paid in BCH, business owners can accept BCH directly as payment for goods or services, and the unemployed can look for work directly in the cryptocurrency economy by contacting BCH based projects or starting with BCH platforms such as [read.cash](https://read.cash) or [Noise.cash](https://noise.cash).
