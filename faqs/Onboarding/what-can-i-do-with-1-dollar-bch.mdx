title: What can I do with $1 of BCH?
---

New users to BCH are often gifted $1 (or some small amount) by an existing user, or acquire a small amount to test it by some other method. As BCH is very micro-transaction friendly, there are a number of things that can be done with this.

Some ideas:

- **Donate to a good cause**: Feed children in Venezuela and South Sudan by donating to BCH charity [EatBCH](https://eatbch.org/). Supporters of free journalism might also like to donate to [WikiLeaks](https://shop.wikileaks.org/donate#db11).
- **Reward someone for good content**: BCH has a version of Twitter called [Noise.cash](https://noise.cash/) and a blogging platform called [Read.cash](https://read.cash/). On both sites, it's easy to reward cool creators by directly sending them a small (or large) amount of BCH. On Noise, click the $x.xx below a post and select QR code to send a tip, and on Read.cash see the donations widget at the bottom of each article where the author's bio is.
- **Play some classic arcade games**: Drop a few cents in BCH into traditional arcade games at [Joystick.club](https://joystick.club/), and win even more back if you dominate the leaderboard!
- **Play with cats**: A BCH supporter has a livestream at [bitrally.cash](https://www.bitrally.cash) that lets viewers tip $0.50 in BCH to drop food and ring a bell for their pet cats, which can be played with via a remotely controlled robot arm.
- **Gamble**: Play one of the earliest Bitcoin apps ever, the famous [Satoshi Dice](https://satoshidice.com/). Choose a risk/reward ratio, send in some coins, and get paid back instantly on a win. The site is "provably fair", which means they generate the wins and losses beforehand in the right ratio and then publish a cryptographic proof of those committments plus the matching transactions at the end of the day - so users know they are not being cheated.
- **Use AI**: You can get pay-by-the-question AI access without an account through the BCH integration at [Nano GPT](https://nano-gpt.com/). **Caution: your BCH deposits will be converted to Nano & not withdrawable as BCH so deposit small!**
- **Share it with a friend**: Now you're part of the BCH community, spread the love! Find a friend that is curious about cryptocurrency, and send them a small amount so they can see how it works too! Particularly effective to try with someone you might have occassion to trade cryptocurrency with more regularly, e.g. a friend you regularly go out for drinks with.
