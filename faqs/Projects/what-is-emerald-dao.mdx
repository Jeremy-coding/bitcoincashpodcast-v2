Emerald DAO is a proof of concept [BCH CashTokens app](/faqs/Tech/what-is-cashtokens) that mints NFTs for timelocked "safe boxes" of BCH which earn a bonus based on donations hoping to incentivise locked BCH (ie improving currency liquidity and encouraging users to withdraw from centralised exchanges).

Check out the website [emerald-dao.cash/](https://emerald-dao.cash/).

For an explanation of what this is, see the [introduction post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cashtokens/comments/13g9huj/announcing_emerald_dao_v210_nft_series/).

See the instructions to trying it out from developer bitcoincashautist [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cashtokens/comments/13ibe1c/how_do_i_get_emerald_dao_token/).
