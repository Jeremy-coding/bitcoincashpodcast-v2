title: What is the Bitcoin Cash Foundation?
---

The Bitcoin Cash Foundation is a community-run organisation for advocacy of Bitcoin Cash that provides:

- A [weekly news service](https://read.cash/@BCHF)
- Free "BCH Accepted Here" stickers for people onboarding local merchants
- Outreach to cryptocurrency websites & service providers to ensure they have HQ BCH logo/media files & remain up to date with network upgrades
- Various other community roles & support

You can read about their work in [this BCHF article](https://medium.com/@BCHF_ORG/year-1-of-the-bchf-4134fd94be76).

## Foundations & Decentralisation

Unlike many centralised cryptocurrencies (who frequently masquerade as "decentralised"), [BCH really is decentralised](/faqs/Decentralisation/is-bitcoin-cash-decentralised).

One of the disqualifying criteria for decentralisation is the presence in many coins of a centrally influential "Foundation". Examples include the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) or the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/). If BCH is decentralised, how can it have a "BCH Foundation"?

Unlike foundations in many other coins, the BCH Foundation project is not "official". It was not started by Satoshi (Bitcoin's founder) & has no premined or pre-allocated share of the BCH supply. It has no control of [BCH development](/faqs/Decentralisation/how-does-BCH-governance-work). It is simply a community run organisation, which has chosen "authoritative sounding" branding for additional impact, just like [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast](/about). It was founded in 2022, over 13 years after BCH's creation in 2009 & has no endorsements except the ones provided by the community. As with everything in BCH, it operates only on a voluntary interaction basis.

Ironically, one of the reasons to choose the name "Bitcoin Cash Foundation" is that many of the entities in the scene (such as news aggregators, exchanges, marketcap listings, event organisers and so on) are so used to dealing with centralised cryptocurrencies that they EXPECT to have a "Foundation" with "authority" that they can talk to. Although BCHF does not have the resources, influence or central control of many other so-called "Foundations" relative to its coin, the ""official"" branding helps to facilitate working with those parties on behalf of the BCH community. You can read more about this [on their endorsements page](https://bitcoincashfoundation.org/endorsements/).
