## Onboarding new retailers

BCH enthusiasts are also encouraged to ask places they shop or their friends if they will accept BCH as a form of payment. Don't force it! The Bitcoin Cash ethos is for users to have individual freedom, freedom to accept or reject Bitcoin Cash (or any currency) as they see fit. However many merchants will be open minded to the idea if they have an ongoing relationship with a repeat customer that they can see enjoys their product, and many individuals will be willing to deal with their friends or family in BCH given the pre-existing foundation of trust. In this way, the BCH economy spreads and opens new trade opportunities to everyone else already trading Bitcoin Cash or other cryptocurrencies without the need for government fiat.
