The Bitcoin Cash community is [decentralised](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), which means there is no one single plan, method, or organisation coordinating its [spreading adoption](/faqs/BCH/is-BCH-spreading). Instead, every Bitcoin Cash adopter is free to use and spread the influence of Bitcoin Cash to any extent & in any manner they choose. This is part of the [philosophy of Bitcoin](/start#episode-3-of-10-philosophy), societal organisation without compulsion. For the same reason, BCH has [no roadmap](/faqs/BCH/does-BCH-have-a-roadmap). This [swarm methodology](https://falkvinge.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/letter-from-the-ceo.pdf) offers no central point of attack & allows adoption to flexibly adapt to the local conditions & resources of each user.

However, decentralised does not mean disorganised. Dedicated members of the Bitcoin Cash community have clear methods & objectives. Ecosystem participants co-operate as necessary on a peer-to-peer basis to progress their own plans & the overall adoption of Bitcoin Cash.

## The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

The Bitcoin Cash Podcast has 2 primary adoption strategies.

1. **Content creation**: ~
2. **Selene Wallet**: ~
