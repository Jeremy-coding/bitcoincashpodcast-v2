_Everyone looks cool in shades._

Observers on social media may notice BCH users have a trend of adorning their profile picture with green tinted sunglasses.

In late 2020, during the BTC price rally from $9 000 to around $69 000, the Bitcoin BTC community developed a social signalling meme trend of attaching "laser eyes" to their profile pictures (particularly on Twitter) with the hashtag #LaserRayTo100k. The idea was to build hype, socially signal to other BTC supporters in comment threads and collectively not remove the laser eyes until the BTC price had reached $100 000. The hype cycle finished at $69k, and over the next several years most of the laser eyes profile pictures gave up and were removed in ashamed failure, but it's still a somewhat common thing to see and has come to represent hardcore BTC supporters as a concept.

_It looks about as scary and cultish as it is._

In 2022, the Bitcoin Cash community began to organically develop a counter-meme of having green-tinted sunglasses on their profile pictures. Symbolically, the sunglasses indicate immunity to the irrationality and nonsense of the laser-eyed BTC community. This is an ongoing part of the contention over [the real Bitcoin](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-the-real-bitcoin) and culture war between BTC & BCH following [the original civil war](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash).

In addition, sunglassess are perenially cool & stylish, everyone looks good in them. The need for sunglasses hints at the bright future of BCH. There's also a sense of preserving privacy, which is something [the Bitcoin Cash community takes seriously](/faqs/BCH/what-about-privacy-on-BCH).

If you're active on social media, maybe join in yourself! You can try to spot other green sunglasses accounts to follow, or update your own profile picture with a green shades picture!
