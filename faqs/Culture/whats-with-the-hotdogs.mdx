_Are you hungry? Might be time for a hotdog._

The Bitcoin Cash community has an ongoing in-joke associating Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with images of or references to hotdogs or deliberately conflating/mislabelling/misunderstanding BCH as an acronym for "Big Costco Hotdog" instead of "Bitcoin Cash".

## Origin

_Hotdogs are getting expensive these days._

The joke started organically on the Bitcoin Cash telegram group for discussing BCH price movements. You can join the fun [here](https://t.me/bchpricechannel).

## Humour

_Hug your hotdogs to let them know they are valued._

The hotdog is quite an appropriate item for this kind of joke because:

- Hotdogs are well-known globally as a casual consumer purchase, the kind of thing that will commonly be bought with Bitcoin Cash once BCH is at [global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency).
- Hotdogs are somewhat phallic and associated with circuses and sports matches which lends them quite a comedic & fun vibe.
- Costco famously has a price freeze on their hotdogs at exactly $1.50, even in the face of rampant inflation & other product cost increase (emphasizing the whole point of limited supply, inflation resistant Bitcoin Cash). It is also ironic/humorous to contrast a "fixed price" hotdog with the enormous volatility of Bitcoin Cash.
