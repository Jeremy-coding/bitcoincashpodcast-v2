_BitInstitutions inadvertently kickstarts the cockroach meme, a tweet he later deleted after being swarmed by mockery from Bitcoin Cashers. Common cockroach W. [Source](https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1944343367808172291)_

Observers on social media may notice BCH users have a recurring joke about cockroaches. The idea is that Bitcoin Cash supporters are like cockroaches: 

- Relentlessly unstoppable (cannot be [hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin))
- Uncaring about an unfavourable public opinion
- Numerous & willing to fight as a [decentralised](/faqs/Decentralisation/is-bitcoin-cash-decentralised) swarm

The early Bitcoin community often used an animal mascot of the honeybadger, a symbol for persistence & resilience in the face of chaos & larger adversaries. This can be seen in the 2013 honeybadger sign that [appears in The BCH Podcast intro](/faqs/Podcast/what-are-the-intro-references#every-year).

The shift from honeybadgers to cockroaches is a BCH cultural evolution similar to the [rebrand from orange to green](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand). The concept of resilience has been even further amplified (would you bet on honeybadgers or cockroaches to survive longest as a species?), while finding a way to distinguish itself from the BTC community [as the two projects continue to diverge](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-just-btc-with-larger-blocks).

This is the BCH community humorously leaning into relentless and unjustified attempts to [villify](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-do-btc-coiners-have-such-a-specific-vendetta-against-bch) and [slander](/faqs/Other/whats-with-the-name-bcash) it. The BCH community is not intimidated by bullying or attempts to denigrate them, and will instead laugh at such ineffective social pressure tactics built on [lies](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) and targeted against a community with such a strong [mission driven purpose](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency).

It has also been adapted into humourous backronyms, for instance "Big Cockroach Hoarders", as with the [Big Costco Hotdogs](/faqs/Culture/whats-with-the-hotdogs).

"Bitcoin CockroacH" is sometimes shortened to "Broach", as in the "Bro-roaches" or BCH being a subjected that "cannot be broached" (which is literally true [as seen in coordinated censorship campaigns against it](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc)).

If you're active on social media, maybe join in yourself! Feel free to make any cockroach related memes or jokes, particularly when BCH is showing resilience and unstoppability!
