SmartBCH assets are currently under seizure by an insolvent CoinFlex. This is a complicated situation, detailed breakdown can be found in [Episode 52](/docs/52) and [Episode 53](/docs/53). Recent updates on [Episode 60](/docs/60).

It is critically important to research SmartBCH and understand the risks thoroughly before using it in any capacity at this time. Further updates will of course appear on the podcast where notable change has happened, but The Bitcoin Cash Podcast suggests avoiding SmartBCH entirely at this time.
