title: Will Bitcoin Cash raise its blocksize?
---

Yes.

Currently the Bitcoin Cash network allows 32 MB blocks, with some miners individually setting a soft-cap on their own block production at a lower value.

After [splitting with Bitcoin Core in 2017]((/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash)), the Bitcoin Cash community initially raised the blocksize limit to 8MB. This was increased again in 2018 to the current 32 MB limit. [Work is currently underway](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/assessing-the-scaling-performance-of-several-categories-of-bch-network-software/754) to raise the limit to 256 MB.

Some people, most notably advocates of Bitcoin SV (frequently former or concurrent Bitcoin Cash adopters), remain perpetually concerned over the issue of blocksize limit. They believe having a limit at all is indicative of "central control" in BCH. They advocate strongly for the agency of miners to decide what is an appropriate blocksize, surely it would be better to have no limit & allow the free market to set the appropriate size of blocks? They foresee potential for the Bitcoin Cash community to repeat the mistakes of the past, and refuse to scale the blocks with growing demand as [happened with BTC](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash).

Although these concerns are understandable (particularly in light of history), the arguments for removing a blocksize limit are naive and lack nuance.

## Adaptive blocksize limit

While having no limit is foolish, the BCH community does recognise that the coordination cost of raising the limit each time is substantial & potential for splitting the community over a divisive issue does exist. To address these concerns, discussion is currently underway over the idea of [having an automatically adapting blocksize](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/general-protocols-opinions-and-considerations-on-a-maxblocksize-adjustment-scheme/1082).
