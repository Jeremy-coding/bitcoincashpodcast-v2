title: Should (or will) Bitcoin Cash rebrand?
---

No.

Due to the conflict with the Bitcoin BTC branding and therefore frequent confusion and the need to perpetually explain the difference and history to new users, it is a common suggestion that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the smaller coin should rebrand.

The community will correctly never do this, for a number of reasons:

- **The real Bitcoin**: The BCH community came into existence to protect the original mission of Bitcoin in Satoshi's whitepaper, a [peer to peer electronic cash system](/bitcoin.pdf). This is the founding ideal of the community, and an ideologically-driven position they will not compromise on under any circumstances. This level of committment is a key strength of the community. Similar to the way North and South Korea both claim to be "the one true" Korea, both do not recognise each other's claim and will fight to their dying breath over that principle, Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash BCH are in the same all-or-nothing struggle. History has not decided who is "the real Bitcoin" until one side surrenders the claim or is totally eliminated, and the Bitcoin Cash community will not surrender, ever. This claim is validated by 4+ years of suffering constant derision due to the minority branding, minority hash rate and disapproval by price speculators. The BTC side claim the same conviction, but have no proof the faith of their community could survive even a single day (let alone years on end) without the unearned default legitimacy and market value of the Bitcoin brand name. There is every possibility that when BCH reclaims majority hashrate, price, and decentralised approval from the marketplace as the real Bitcoin that the demoralised BTC community (who would have to pick a new name and identity, perhaps "Bitcoin Core") will splinter into pieces and be gone forever.
- **Proven resilience**: The original Bitcoin community grew in size and strength from a tiny core because its own narrative and committment to the project was so strong that it ignored and swept past endless amounts of doubt, criticism, ridicule and marginalisation. Instead, the Bitcoin community refused to bend or be ignored and carried on its mission. Nothing is more convincing of a project's strength than demonstrating this singleminded focus to outside observers through years of persistence. The BCH community is even more famous for this obstinancy than the original Bitcoin community, and it must maintain this image to be a credible replacement for BTC and candidate to be used by the entire world. This approach is an example of an [Intolerant Minority strategy](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15).
- **Consumer education**: Confusion over the BTC and BCH brand is a burden of user education, which is overwhelmingly shouldered by BCH as the minority community. This contains a subtle but powerful advantage, consumers **cannot choose BCH from ignorance**. Many speculators or misinformed market participants may choose BTC by default without understanding the history or trade-offs against BCH (either unaware of it, or misinformed that it is a "scam"), but the reverse is not true. In aggregate, this means the BCH community is far more educated on cryptocurrency generally, far more dedicated to the community vision, and far more resilient in a time of crisis. Former BTC supporters are common in the BCH community, but the reverse is vanishingly rare or unheard of. Over time, this one-way flow of converts is a key advantage for BCH.
- **Consumer trust**: Being associated with the Bitcoin branding can be confusing, but it has a silver lining. Consumers trust the Bitcoin brand as it is most familiar, and even if it is confusing they will still trust something linked to Bitcoin after some explanation far faster than they will develop that trust for any of the other 10 000+ unrelated cryptocurrency brands.
- **Existing network effect**: Changing might prevent conflict with BTC, but it also destroys several years of work establishing the current BCH brand and there is no evidence that would be a worthwhile trade.

Note that calls for BCH to rebrand frequently come from the BTC community themselves. This is an indication they feel threatened and insecure about their ability to win the war for Bitcoin against BCH, as they rarely make the same overtures to the far smaller Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold, or other Bitcoin fork communities.
