title: Is Bitcoin Cash decentralised?
---

Yes.

~~

Every part of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem - from miners to nodes to developers to businesses to consumers - operates 100% voluntarily. Nobody can force anyone else to do or not do anything, ~~. This operates in complete contrast to fiat currency systems, which persist by enslaving populations through involuntary taxation enforced at gunpoint.

Bitcoin Cash is [decentralised](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), so there is no central party who could create a roadmap that had any authority. If anyone did create a roadmap, its authority would be limited to the willingness of the rest of the ecosystem to adhere to it.

Instead, the [CHIP process](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), helps to co-ordinate network upgrades in the upcoming yearly cycle.

There is nothing preventing individual community members from trying to aggregate or clarify the state of BCH development in their own **non-authoritative** roadmap, as per [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast Roadmap](/roadmap). However such efforts seem to stagnate because they are high effort to maintain and produce little value. This isn't a problem, just an organic discovery of the best process for Bitcoin Cash to develop.
