_Corbin Fraser (CEO of Bitcoin.com) explains the history of the BCH chain-split & Roger Ver's (un)involvement on The Bitcoin Takeover Podcast._

BCH was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 (2008 including the publishing of the whitepaper). This is self-evident in the blockchain containing transactions from 2009 & many BCHers who contributed to BTC before the split maintaining that they never changed the project they were working on (see discussion of [Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) the real Bitcoin?](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-the-real-bitcoin))

The chain-split (be careful [not to conflate with a hard-fork](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork), although it was also that) between BTC & BCH occurred on 1st August 2017 & was conducted by a group of big blockers lead by Amaury Sechet. Frequent cited contributors include Jonald Fyookball, freetrader, Jonathan Toomim & others. Another account of the split is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bvj08f/an_incomplete_history_of_the_bitcoin_cashs_origin/), reproduced [here](https://x.com/bchautist/status/1898511139920822699).

## Roger Ver propaganda

There is a common strain of propaganda, [among many others](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc#notable-propaganda), that BCH was created by Roger Ver as some kind of scam - rather than an organic effort by a section of the community to prevent the ongoing hijacking during The Blocksize War.

Crucially, the chain split from BTC (1st August 2017) **did not involve Roger Ver**, who only became involved after the collapse of the SegWit2x efforts (in November 2017). He was not involved in the chain-split initially, and his involvement later was simply in support of it as a businessman & free-market advocate that believed in the [technical roadmap](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency) for big block scaling. There are many accounts of this, including his own in [Hijacking Bitcoin](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin).

Accusations that BCH is "Roger's project" or that he created it are sometimes simply misguided but are very frequently [deliberate propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc). Any source that is promulgating this false information should be treated with very high skepticism - on this issue & any other related information about Bitcoin & BCH.
