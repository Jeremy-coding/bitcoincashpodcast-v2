MUSD is a stablecoin that allows users to borrow from the Moria Treasury, a contract. Users must provide, at a minimum 150%, collateral in BCH. MUSD is built on the Moria Protocol.

The Moria Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol built on top of the [CashTokens](what-is-cashtokens) system on Bitcoin Cash. It's currently being used to allow users to mint the MUSD stablecoin. You can check out the [Moria Protocol White Paper.](/Moria-Whitepaper.pdf)
