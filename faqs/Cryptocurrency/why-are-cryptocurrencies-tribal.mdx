title: Why are cryptocurrency communities so tribal?
---

People new to the scene often discover that many cryptocurrency communities are very set in their beliefs, to the point of actively or aggressively excluding other coins or points of view even. This is because:

1. **Financial investment**: Many people have a financial investment in their chosen coin succeeding.
2. **Emotional investment**: Many people have an emotional investment in their chosen coin succeeding (e.g. tensions between BCH and BTC camps after the Blocksize war, but there are plenty of examples).
3. **All-or-nothing outcome**: Cryptocurrency is a "winner take most" phenomenon. Cryptocurrency is an absolutely cut-throat free market, with no rules and lots of competition. Due to the network effect (a currency is better when more people trade it), the first coin to truly breakthrough to the mainstream in adoption will outstrip every other coin 100x in size. This means that every coin has to be playing to win, and if a coin's community is not planning to go to #1 then they're better off not bothering to try at all. Of course this produces a very "us against the world" mentality by default.

Bitcoin Cash is shooting to be the coin used everyday by the whole world, so it does have that mindset.

**NOTE!** This does NOT mean the BCH community should be unwelcoming, closed to innovations in other coins, hostile or exclusionary (a mistake made by some other communities). Individuals can allocate their own resources among any number of coins as they see fit. However, the overall Bitcoin Cash community attitude will be along the lines of "We are going to make BCH so much better than every other coin, that eventually everyone in the world will want to trade it."
