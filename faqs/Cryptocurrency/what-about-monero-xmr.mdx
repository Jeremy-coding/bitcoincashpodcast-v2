title: What about Monero (XMR)?
---

:::tip

Every coin has its pros and cons, and so an unbiased objective take is impossible. Cryptocurrency is a free market of ideas and voluntary involvement, and the best coins must prove themselves in it, including BCH. Readers are encouraged to explore the communities, apps and events that other coins have to offer and hear both sides of the argument. However, as a candidate for [being the global reserve currency](/faqs/Podcast/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency), other coins tend to have serious flaws that make them a less viable candidate than BCH.

The Monero community is perhaps the closest ideological cousin of the Bitcoin Cash community, and there is significant cross pollination of users and ideas. Both coins focus on optimising as much as possible to the fundamental principles of money and being a peer-to-peer electronic cash. Monero users are heavily focussed on privacy protection, as that is built into the core protocol, and frequently highlight the improved fungibility of XMR vs BCH or other coins. This also leads to it being regularly used on darknet markets, which may be a leading indicator for adoption similar to the ways that Bitcoin in its early days was used the same way.

However, these advantages come with significant trade-offs, that make global adoption of Monero very very unlikely.

- **Inflation bugs**: Due to Monero's more complicated cryptography, there is an increased chance of unnoticed software bugs creeping into XMR nodes. While the likelihood or degree to which this is a problem is subject to debate, there is no debate that it is a higher chance than for a very easily verifiable supply currency such as Bitcoin Cash. Given that scarcity of supply is a critical component of cryptocurrency's monetary properties, this decrease in verifiability is a big issue.
- **Regulatory pressure**: Although [government can't stop cryptocurrency](/faqs/Roadblocks/what-if-governments-ban-crypto), Monero has been delisted from many consumer-friendly centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. This decreases the ability for the coin to spread among average consumers, especially relative to other coins competing in the "cash" use case.
- **Wallet scanning**: As a result of the privacy features, Monero wallets must scan the blockchain for incoming payments. This process can be quite slow, and would be made vastly worse if Monero were to achieve global adoption. Currently, the only way to avoid this is by having a server scan on the user's behalf, but this comes at a significant cost to privacy. There is an upcoming upgrade called [Seraphis](https://www.getmonero.org/2021/12/22/what-is-seraphis.html) that would help to mitigate this, however.
- **10-block locktime**: Newly-received XMR cannot be spent for 10 blocks, about 20 minutes. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash can be spent instantly. This temporary lock can interfere with day-to-day usage, making Monero unwieldy as a general-purpose currency.
- **Scalability**: Monero transactions consume more storage than Bitcoin Cash transactions, due to their obfuscated nature. Blockchain pruning is also not as effective in Monero for the same reason. This severely hinders its ability to be used at global scale with large numbers of running nodes to ensure decentralisation. More discussion of Monero's scalability issues can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/rzxzmx/why_bch_not_xmr/hrynhp3/).


The BCH community is heavily committed to privacy as a core tenet of sound money. However, it has a [different approach](/faqs/BCH/what-about-privacy-on-BCH) to the Monero community.
