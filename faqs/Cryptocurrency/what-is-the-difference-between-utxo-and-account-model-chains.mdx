title: What is the difference between UTXO & account model chains?
---

Although presented as a homogenous list on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or in the ubiquitous branding of "cryptocurrencies", the broad spectrum of projects under the "cryptocurrency" banner obscures a baffling array of distinctions & subcategories. Everything from underlying technology, economic design, funding, political governance, decentralisation & many other factors differs wildly among projects in a chaotic, ever-changing mess. If it helps, consider "cryptocurrency" as a term somewhat akin to "biology", which encompasses a huge tree of differentiated matter from single-celled organisms to plants, animals & humans.

Before explaining UTXO vs Account model, it is important to clarify the distinction between cryptocurrencies & networks.

## Networks vs Currencies

This article is dealing with cryptocurrency **networks**, not **cryptocurrencies**, although they overlap.

A cryptocurrency **network** **<u>must</u>** have:

-  Its own physical infrastructure:
- - Nodes (servers) that run the network
- - Miners or validators to append transactions to the blockchain
- It's own social infrastructure, a community ecosystem of:
- - Developers
- - Infrastructure providers
- - Wallets
- - Discussion forums & news services 
- - ... & so on.

A **cryptocurrency** does **<u>NOT necessarily require its own physical infrastructure</u>**, though many have it. This is because a cryptocurrency can operate without its own physical infrastructure by existing as a token that flows across one (or more) other cryptocurrency networks. In this case, the "parasite" cryptocurrency uses the "host" cryptocurrency network to provide the physical servers & blockchain upon which its tokens are transacted. The term "parasite" is a little unkind, as the relationship is usually symbiotic (except in extreme cases). The "parasite" currency brings transaction demand, attention/marketing & ecosystem activity to the host network in exchange for piggybacking on its physical (& sometimes social) infrastructure.

For example: Bitcoin Cash is both a cryptocurrency AND a cryptocurrency network. The same for [Bitcoin Core](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc), [Ethereum](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-ethereum-eth) & [Dogecoin](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-dogecoin-doge).

However: [Tether](/faqs/Scams/tether) is a cryptocurrency that does NOT have its own cryptocurrency network. There are no "Tether nodes" or "Tether miners". Tethers are tokens traded across a variety of physical cryptocurrency networks, including [Ethereum](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-ethereum-eth), Binance Smart Chain & others. This is also true of USDC, Shiba Inu (SHIB) & many others.

Note also that [chain-splits](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork#chain-split) are a special case of a cryptocurrency network dividing into two cryptocurrencies each with its own separate network, not just one cryptocurrency dividing into two cryptocurrencies on the same network. This division of physical infrastructure (& surrounding community) is both incredibly traumatic & rare. Tokens on the host network may also be duplicated as a result.

Yes, it's quite confusing!

## UTXO vs Account model

Roughly speaking, cryptocurrency networks (NOT cryptocurrencies) can be divided at a technical level into three buckets: `UTXO chains`, `Account model chains` & `Other`. Note that this is an oversimplification, but serves as a good starting point.

### UTXO

UTXO stands for "Unspent Transaction Output". This is the "classic" cryptocurrency design, pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Popular UTXO model chains include Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Core, [Litecoin](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-litecoin-ltc), [Dogecoin](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-dogecoin-doge) & [Monero](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-monero-xmr). 

UTXO chains _tend_ to be the "old school" networks launched 2016 or earlier & they also _tend_ to be Proof of Work instead of Proof of Stake, but those are trends rather than requirements.

There are also variations within the UTXO category. [Monero](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-monero-xmr) is a UTXO chain but has protocol-level privacy adapations which make it noticeably distinct from similar chains like BCH or LTC. [Cardano](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-cardano-ada) has a modified UTXO variation they call the "eUTXO" (extended UTXO) model intended to increase the usability for smart contracts.

### Account model

Account model chains have the following tendencies (frequently have these attributes, although these are NOT strict requirements):

- _Tend_ to be the "newer" cryptocurrency networks launched in 2017 or later
- _Tend_ to be Proof of Stake rather than Proof of Work.
- _Tend_ to be "EVM compatible".

All of these elements derive from the way account model chains gained significant popularity ~~.

### Other chains

The vast majority of cryptocurrency networks are either UTXO model or Account model. The advantages of differentiating from these two are fairly slim, it's a chance to blaze a new technical path and perhaps be recognised as an industry leader. The downside is brutally severe & unavoidable - incompatibility with other cryptocurrency ecosystems. In changing from the more understood models, an upstart network consigns itself to rebuilding all of its infrastructure, software & consumer education from scratch (a very, very uphill battle). Chains that adopt the more common UTXO or Account models do also have an uphill battle in terms of [branding](/) and [consumer adoption](/).

For this reason, cryptocurrency networks in the "Other" category are uncommon, but they do exist. [Nano](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-nano-xno) is one example.
