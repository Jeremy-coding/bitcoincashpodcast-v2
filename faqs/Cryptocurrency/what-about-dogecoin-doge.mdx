title: What about Dogecoin (DOGE)?
---

:::tip

Every coin has its pros and cons, and so an unbiased objective take is impossible. Cryptocurrency is a free market of ideas and voluntary involvement, and the best coins must prove themselves in it, including BCH. Readers are encouraged to explore the communities, apps and events that other coins have to offer and hear both sides of the argument. However, as a candidate for being the global reserve currency, other coins tend to have serious flaws that make them a less viable candidate than BCH.

Dogecoin has done a great job making cryptocurrency approachable and introducing new people to the scene. However it is not viable to be a world currency, even if Elon Musk thinks that would be funny.

The attraction of the Doge community originally was their lighthearted, charitable attitude. For a small network, that's fine, but as the network scales up in both technical investment and financial investment the "haha this is all just for fun" vibe starts to die pretty quickly. Without that spirit, Dogecoin has a dearth of development, infrastructure or serious committment to the project beyond making a few jokes or charitable donations. On top of that, a rapidly appreciating price quickly turns from "This is all for fun" to "let's get rich!", a free ride attitude that cannot be sustained during an inevitable pullback.
