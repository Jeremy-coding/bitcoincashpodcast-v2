_Psychedelic Bart [fails to realise](https://x.com/PsychedelicBart/status/1915159720299552994) what [Daniel Prince has](https://x.com/Princey21M/status/1915134867072786732) - if you don't actively fight to preserve the [philosophy of Bitcoin](/start#episode-3-of-10-philosophy) you [end up hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin). Maybe by [Tether](/faqs/Scams/tether)._

Yes, Bitcoin is **permisionless** & **open to everyone** but **<u>that doesn't mean all network participants should be treated to either warm welcomes or indifferent unconcern by its active community</u>**.

Bitcoin is for everyone. It is permissionless & censorship resistant by design - so anyone can be involved. Anyone of any moral or legal or political persuasion (including [criminals and scammers](/start#episode-7-of-10-adoption-mania-and-scams)), any kind of organisation and in fact even any entity (not necessarily human, machines are actually well suited to Bitcoin) can use the protocol. This means that ideological "enemies" of Bitcoin including [banks](/start#episode-6-of-10-banks), [governments](/start#episode-5-of-10-government) & certain large corporations will inevitably invest in it and become involved in the ecosystem. There is no way to stop or prevent that, Bitcoin would not be permisionless if anyone could gatekeep them out. In fact, acquiring Bitcoin is simply the incentive system driving [its adoption as global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency). Once banks buy into Bitcoin they become partly invested in its success rather than its obstruction. Acquiring Bitcoin does not give them direct control over [governance](/faqs/Decentralisation/how-does-BCH-governance-work) of the protocol or any other special consideration - even though they may be wealthy investors - so in this sense there is no need for concern about their participation.

**HOWEVER**, Bitcoin is not an independently operating force of nature like gravity or volcanic activity. It is a technological project & humanitarian movement that will only deliver what its participants make of it (especially the most involved & committed individuals). It has its own [philosophy](/start#episode-3-of-10-philosophy), [history](/recommended#history) & [culture](/faqs#culture). But just like any culture or community - if its history & values are not preserved, retold, reinforced & encouraged then it will fade away as it is overtaken by stronger cultures or competing interests (which will in time subvert the technology). Continually safeguarding Bitcoin culture is the responsibility of all passionate Bitcoiners & it means maintaining cultural resistance (to the greatest extent possible) to opposed interests that would benefit from diluting or misdirecting it (perhaps by seemingly enthusiastic involvement). It means encouraging adopters more aligned with the network while tolerating the rest by necessity rather than actively embracing them or giving them a free pass.

## BTC culture

Particularly in "modern" (2024 or later) BTC culture there is a general apathetic acceptance or even encouragement of large financial players & governments becoming involved in the industry. They argue "We can't stop banks!" or "Bitcoin is for everyone!" as though this justifies abdicating all personal responsibility & necessity of maintaining the project's culture & direction. This is due to a conflation of the inability to prevent banking involvement (i.e. permissionlessness) with the social reality that external motivated players are probably uninterested in (or even actively intending to dispose of) the [ethos](/start#episode-3-of-10-philosophy) & [mission](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency) of [the real Bitcoin](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-the-real-bitcoin). This attitude is a part of the reason their coin [became hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin) and is an apathetic attitude introduced by [propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc).

The BCH community must resist the involvement of banks & governments - to the extent it is able - through education, advocacy & governance or it will suffer the same fate. Banks may own BCH satoshis or build on the BCH network, but that doesn't mean they should be given an iota more influence than their proven mission-aligned proof-of-work. It is critical that resisting banking interference is a part of the [authentic BCH brand](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand) and it maintains cultural momentum on initiatives like [BCH Bank Run](/faqs/Culture/what-is-bch-bank-run) to delay & resist the constantly encroaching tide of hostile interference. This is one way the BCH community must [avoid falling into the same issues seen on BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/will-BCH-inevitably-run-into-BTC-problems-at-scale).
