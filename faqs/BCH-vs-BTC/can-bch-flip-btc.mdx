title: Can BCH flip BTC?
---

Absolutely.

At least 99% (more like 99.99%) of the world's population does not conduct **daily** commerce in **any cryptocurrency**. Even the vast majority of BTC "adopters" do not earn & spend BTC every day in a circular BTC economy - the vast majority sit their coins in storage and pray that one day something will change and it will somehow become a functional economy. Very little of their ecosystem perceives this as a problem, believing time will somehow inevitably make their nonsensical scaling plans viable. [Even at a BTC conference, payments are rarely made in BTC & most interest & development has shifted to competitors](https://twitter.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1512118959642136576). This is one of [many problems with BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/hasnt-btc-already-won).

BCH may be behind at the moment in the [race to be global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency), but the contest is still in its early stages. Any cryptocurrency (BTC, BCH, Ethereum or any other) has a long road ahead in terms of technical, social, economic & cultural development before it can universally replace fiat currency as humanity's daily medium of exchange and command a decisive majority of the world's economic activity.

Theoretically, BCH could flippen BTC at any time. No coins needs to move on either chain for market sentiment to decide buyers are less willing to sell on-chain BCH than on-chain BTC.

In practice, BCH has to make a convincing case to the market that it is the more valuable form of money - through superior technological innovation, promotion, brand recognition, daily userbase, trade liquidity and so on.

Bitcoin Cash has some unique elements though which substantially improve its chances of taking the #1 crypto spot from BTC, especially in a relatively short timeframe.

- **Block lead**: A completely accidental legacy of the [controversial chain split](/) & subsequent improvements to the BCH difficulty adjustment algorithm is BCH now retains roughly a [3 000 block lead](https://cash.coin.dance/stats) over BTC (by block count, not by total proof of work). In general this is a meaningless & arbitrary distinction EXCEPT for the unique factor that fresh BCH coin supply halves (as per the Bitcoin supply schedule) about 20 days (nearly 3 weeks) before the corresponding change in BTC. This opens a regular window every 4 years where the BCH price ratio is expected to rise against BTC & a flippening / death spiral might start.

Some cryptocurrency adopters may have heard of "The Flippening" in relation to Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin, but its origin is from the Bitcoin Cash community.

There is even precedent for a Flippening,
