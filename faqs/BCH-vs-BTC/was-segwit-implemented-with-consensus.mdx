_Bitcoin Mechanic explains that SegWit was added to BTC despite the concerns and disagreement of big blockers._

No. SegWit was never implemented with consensus. "Consensus" means that everyone agrees, but during the [Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash) the SegWit upgrade was added to BTC using a soft-fork which the big blocker/BCH community rejected with a [chain split](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork). This is sometimes used to generally [demonize the BCH community](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-do-btc-coiners-have-such-a-specific-vendetta-against-bch), many years later, as people who could not "respect consensus" or who somehow didn't understand how Bitcoin works. Neither of those things is true. If anything, the **implementation of SegWit was disrespectful of consensus** given the enormous controversy surrounding it at the time.

The existence of BCH is proof on its face that a large section of the Bitcoin community disagreed with SegWit and the community was not in consensus for its implementation. If everyone had agreed, there would never be a [chain split](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork) at all, let alone one with a thriving community nearly a decade later. This is before even factoring in all the [censorship](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc) and [propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) implemented to stamp down opposition.

Contrast this with the 2021 Taproot soft-fork upgrade to BTC. No [chain splits](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork) emerged from that, as everyone involved agreed with it - it had consensus.

Some other important notes:

- [SegWit was NOT a blocksize increase](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/didnt-btc-already-increase-the-blocksize), although it created more transaction capacity and allows larger blocks.
- The BCH community fixed transaction malleability WITHOUT SegWit, so there is no technical barrier to a [BCH Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network). SegWit was never needed to fix transaction malleability.
- SegWit specifically is a part of dispute over [the real Bitcoin](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-the-real-bitcoin) among Bitcoin purists.
