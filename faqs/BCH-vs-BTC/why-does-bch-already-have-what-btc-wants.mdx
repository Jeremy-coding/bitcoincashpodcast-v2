_Sucks to suck._

As time passes since the [split in 2017](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), BCH & BTC [become increasingly different](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-just-btc-with-larger-blocks).

However, having a common origin & technological underpinning, many good ideas for upgrades are shared between the BTC & BCH community via convergent evolution or cross referencing. Since BTC is [hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin) & full of [propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc), they have fallen behind **more than a decade** of mutually desired **protocol upgrades, tooling, conferences & more** - which the BCH community simply shipped to production while the BTC community dithered (or: were gaslit & delayed by their hijackers and [cope](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc#unplugging--reversing-propaganda)).

## BCH has, BTC wants

The BCH Podcast maintains a complete evolving list of these items with examples of the BTC community requesting them [here](https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1839339408669229364). Naming conventions differ, significantly similar ideas are annotated as necessary. As of March 2025, the list is:

- ✅ Transaction Introspection (BTC: "CTV - Check Template Verify", lesser version of the same concept).
- ✅ [ABLA](/faqs/BCH/what-is-the-maximum-bch-blocksize). Some members of the BTC community make [doomed requests for increased blocksizes](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size).
- ✅ OP_CAT.
- ✅ [VM Limits](/faqs/Tech/Protocol-Upgrades/2025-velma) (BTC: "Great Script Restoration", lesser version of the same concept).
- ✅ 64 bit integers & Big Int Maths (BCH shipped the latter as part of [Velma](/faqs/Tech/Protocol-Upgrades/2025-velma)).
- ✅ Advanced code tooling (BCH has [CashScript, BitAuthIDE & more](/code#for-building-javascript-applications) that far outstrip BTC alternatives - since the BCH community has the far improved technology to need it).
- ✅ Conferences discussing big block scaling (eg. a BTC conference like [OP_NEXT](https://opnext.dev/) is just a very outdated version of [BCH BLISS](/faqs/Events/BLISS), as satirised [here](/TheBCHPodcast/status/1902755839510733089)).
- ✅ Fixes to time warp bug, quadratic hashing issue & 64 byte transactions (BTC: "Great Consensus Cleanup", BCH is not affected by the timewarp bug due to its [upgraded difficulty adjustment algorithm](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-low-hashrate-a-problem) & shipped fixes to the others years prior).

Due to their [vindictive pride](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-do-btc-coiners-have-such-a-specific-vendetta-against-bch) or [ignorance in censorship](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc), the BTC community remain partially (and often deliberately) unaware of their accelerating inferiority. Whenever they DO come to finally encounter the disparity, their attempts at rationalising & debating it are often incredibly comedic insights into human psychology. See this classic example from The Podcast where BTC guys try to reason out how the BCH community has presciently frontrun them technologically:
