title: If BCH is so great, why is the price (against BTC or USD) so low?
---

Although there are [a lot of reasons](/faqs/BCH/why-bitcoin-cash) to expect BCH to [outcompete BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc) as [the real Bitcoin](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-the-real-bitcoin) and become [global reserve currency](/faqs/Podcast/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency) in the long run, it is still true that so far BCH has performed poorly on the open market, particularly with regards to the exchange rate.

Even if it's true that [BCH is not dead](/faqs/Other/is-bitcoin-cash-dead), [BTC has not won](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/hasnt-btc-already-won) & [BCH can flip BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/can-bch-flip-btc), doesn't this market vote empirically demonstrate that BCH isn't that great after all?

How can the price be so low if BCH supporters are correct that it's much better than BTC?

There are a number of factors to consider:

- **Initial snowball**: The BTC community ~~. They received the existing Bitcoin brand, exchange ticker (and more importantly, all of the trade liquidity & technical integrations), control of the Github repository, majority of the mining hash rate, control of central (at the time) discussion platforms [/r/Bitcoin](https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) & bitcointalk.
- **Unrealised future benefit**: The initial reason to split, increasing the blocksize ~~. The BCH community is playing for keeps, shooting for [global reserve currency](/faqs/Podcast/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency) over a period of decades, and its initial reason to break away provided no immediate benefit. In the same way that an expert chess player might sacrifice a valuable piece in the short term to gain a long term positional advantage, BCH had to suffer in the short term to maintain its long term scaling viability. Much as with the chess players the benefit of this kind of move is only apparent to a sophisticated observer thinking over the long run (which the market does not). Consider the popular saying "In the short term, the market is a popularity contest & in the long term a weighing machine". Note that the situation is reversed for BTC. Their stagnant technical choices and social consensus were beneficial at the time of the split - was reinforced by the short-term momentum - but are now becoming deep sticking points [as their scaling plans falter](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network) & they are [intractably bogged down in their past decisions](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size).

Consider also that BCH is nowhere near as far behind as a simple price chart would suggest.

- **Conceptual similarity**: Most of the fundamental concepts of Bitcoin are shared between the coins. A 21 million limit, proof of work mining, decentralised community, self custody of funds, how to use a wallet, the problems with fiat currency and so on. All the education & branding & trust built by the much-larger BTC community incidentally benefits the credibility of BCH to almost the same extent. Once someone is convinced Bitcoin is a viable idea and/or knows how to use it - the jump from BTC to BCH is a trivial adjustment. This is one of the critical reasons the [BCH community remains defiant with its branding](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand).
- **Shared mining**: All of the innovation & work that goes into the BTC mining industry (funded by BTC speculators and users paying high transfer fees) is received by BCH completely for free.
