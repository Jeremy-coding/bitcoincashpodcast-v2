_Censorship is an implicit admission to conceding the intellectual debate._

Fast spreading adoption of Bitcoin from 2009 to 2015 was only derailed by the suspicious imposition of [massive censorship during the Blocksize War](/). These issues have been [well documented](/). However, the censorship was overall incredibly effective & has led to many BTC believers having strong opinions (and misconceptions) about Bitcoin because they have never seen or explored an open discussion of alternative arguments.

Along with explicit censorship, there is also implicit self-censorship of many BTC adopters. Many current or curious Bitcoin adopter, who very reasonably are interested in experimenting with, investing in or discussing alternative cryptocurrencies, feel anxious about voicing their opinions in BTC dominated spaces for fear of lashback.

Fortunately, the truth cannot be suppressed forever. ~~.

This isn't merely a historical relic of the past, something the BTC community needed at the time of the Blocksize War but has "grown out of". Persistent censorship occurs in the ecosystem as of 2023.

In tragically comedic fashion, many of the individuals who cheered censorship & ~~ are then bamboozled & outraged once their own ideas are the ones being forcibly ejected from the conversation.
