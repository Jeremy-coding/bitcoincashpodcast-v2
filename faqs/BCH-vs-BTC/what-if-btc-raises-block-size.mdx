title: If BCH improved on BTC by raising the 1MB block size limit, what if BTC does the same?

They won't.

By definition, everyone who supported raising the block size left the BTC community (some to BCH, some elsewhere) [after BTC refused to cooperate on it](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). The remaining BTC individuals, unswayed by years of passionate debate, were totally steadfast that raising the block size should never be an option, and they actively rooted out and censored any dissenting voices. Since then, new community members have only been told one side of the story, and are even less likely to be interested in a block size increase.

If there was ever a question of raising the limit, the heretical thinker would be cast out and find it easier to switch to Bitcoin Cash than to convince an entire community zealously against the idea. Even if a substantial minority liked the idea, their ideas could only lead to the same hostile fork outcome (and chaos in the BTC community) as BCH has already been through. This involves at minimum:

- Years of pre-fork debate, consternation and stalled community progress.
- Possible failure to launch an upgraded fork.
- Possible further splits from competing camps within the renegades after a fork is successfully launched (as BCH had with BSV and XEC).
- Years of downward price pressure from 1MB believers dumping their coins.
- Fracturing network effect for BTC based businesses, exchange liquidity, software projects, community forums etc.
- A need to coalese on a new brand and governance structure.
- Enormous confusion by existing BTC holders who may or may not be aware of or involved in the fork crisis.
- A minimum of several years operation to build confidence in the market of the project's longevity.

Years of debate plus years of post-fork chaos is time that BCH would continue to forge further ahead uninterrupted. No one in the BTC camp is convinced of raising the limit, and if they change their minds it's far, far easier to change sides and join the existing BCH momentum than start again.

Prominent influencers in the BTC scene all believe firmly and publicly in the 1MB approach, and if they change their tune it would be a huge credibility and reputational loss and immediately reignite discussion that perhaps BCH has been right all along.

Even in the very, very unlikely scenario that BTC did agree to raise the blocksize limit (perhaps due to a surging BCH) without a calamitous meltdown, that only gets them to the point BCH was at 1st August 2017. Since then, BCH has been building further and further ahead, and BTC has a long way to catch up. Scaling via blocksize is more straightforward than [building a Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network), but it still requires a lot of work on optimising node software and network capacity planning.

Finally, raising the block size limit does not fix the underlying social problem of BTC, that it has a single developer team (Bitcoin Core) who have dictatorial control over the protocol development. Soon enough, another issue would occur where that central point of control proved a critical weakness either intentionally or unintentionally. [Bitcoin Cash has already fixed this problem](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), with proven ability to reject development teams if necessary, as seen with the fork from BTC and later the fork from XEC (eCash).
