title: If BCH improved on BTC by raising the 1MB block size limit, what if BTC does the same?

They won't.

Bitcoin Cash already **is** the Bitcoin which raised the blocksize limit when it was necessary.

By definition, everyone who supported raising the block size left the BTC community (some to BCH, some elsewhere) [after BTC refused to cooperate on it](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). The remaining BTC individuals, unswayed by years of passionate debate, were totally steadfast that raising the block size should never be an option, and they actively rooted out and censored any dissenting voices. Since then, new BTC community members have only been told one side of the story, and are even less likely to be interested in a block size increase.

If there was ever a question of raising the limit, the heretical thinker would be cast out and find it easier to switch to Bitcoin Cash than to convince an entire community zealously against the idea. Even if a substantial minority liked the idea, their ideas could only lead to the same hostile fork outcome (and chaos in the BTC community) as BCH has already been through. This involves **at minimum**:

- Years of pre-fork debate, consternation and stalled community progress.
- Possible failure to launch an upgraded fork. A hostile chain split is a chaotic and risky last-resort exercise, with a very uncertain chance of surviving at all.
- Possible further splits among competing camps within the renegades after a fork is successfully launched (as BCH had with BSV and XEC).
- A need to coalesce on [a new brand](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand) and [governance structure](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work).
- Further technical changes to facilitate competing as an independent Bitcoin fork e.g. a new address format, modifications to difficulty adjustment algorithm, replay protection implementation etc.
- Years of downward price pressure from 1MB believers dumping their coins.
- Fracturing network effect for BTC based businesses, exchange liquidity, software projects, community forums etc.
- Deliberate disruption from 1MB supporters and business models that rely on no blocksize increase (e.g. the [Lightning network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network) ecosystem).
- Enormous confusion by existing BTC holders who may or may not be aware of or involved in the fork crisis.
- A minimum of several years operation to build confidence in the project's resiliency.

BCH is already many years ahead of passing through this entire gauntlet, and any theoretical new fork has yet to start it. Years of debate plus years of post-fork chaos is time that BCH would continue to forge even further ahead uninterrupted. No one in the BTC camp is convinced of raising the limit, and if they change their minds it's far, far easier to change sides and join the existing BCH momentum than start again.

Prominent influencers in the BTC scene all believe firmly and publicly in the 1MB approach, and if they change their tune it would be a huge credibility and reputational loss and immediately reignite discussion that perhaps BCH has been right all along.

Even in the very, very unlikely scenario that BTC did agree to raise the blocksize limit (perhaps due to a surging BCH) without a calamitous meltdown, that only gets them to the point BCH was at 1st August 2017. Since then, BCH has been building further and further ahead, and BTC has a long way to catch up.

- **Scaling**: Scaling via blocksize is more straightforward than [building a Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network), but it still requires a lot of work on optimising node software, supporting infrastructure, mining optimisations and network capacity planning.
- **Tech**: BCH kept developing after the split. [AnyHedge](/faqs/Tech/what-is-anyhedge), [CashTokens](/faqs/Tech/what-is-cashtokens) and other innovations took years of work for the community to research, develop, debate and coordinate into production. BTC of course has not started this process of upgrading their chain, instead they've made things worse with changes like SegWit and Taproot leading to the [Ordinals mess](/docs/71).
- **Tooling**: Everything around the BCH scaling and tech is another big layer of hard work. Community buy-in, developer tools and libraries. Scaling and tech require work above and beyond the protocol level, and that work isn't quick or cheap to coordinate in a decentralised ecosystem.

Finally, raising the block size limit does not fix the underlying social problem of BTC, that it has a single developer team (Bitcoin Core) who have dictatorial control over the protocol development. Soon enough, another issue would occur where that central point of control proved a critical weakness either intentionally or unintentionally. [Bitcoin Cash has already fixed this problem](/faqs/BCH/how-does-BCH-governance-work), with proven ability to reject development teams if necessary, as seen with the fork from BTC and later the fork from XEC (eCash).
