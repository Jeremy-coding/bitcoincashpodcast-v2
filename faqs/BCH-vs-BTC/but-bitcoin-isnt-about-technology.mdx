_My simple strategy for [engaging productively with BCH haters](https://x.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1944345612645716336) is sometimes (very reasonably) [posed in reverse on me by BTC advocates](https://x.com/thekylehuber/status/1948461445626429949)._




Their argument is that Bitcoin is primarily an *economic* innovation (facilitated by or in combination with its technological aspects), not a technological one. By this line of reasoning, technological improvements are ~. In their view, the BCH community is foolish to spend so much time & effort ~. Even if such efforts produce something interesting or useful, it can never outweigh the "economic factors" that drive interest in BTC.







The Bitcoin Cash Podcast exists to [make BCH the global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency). However, that's subordinate to the *intended* goal of **freeing humanity from central bank control & fiat currency**. If there was a more viable way to do it than spreading BCH adoption, logically the Podcast would switch to that - but to my knowledge it doesn't exist.

Sometimes BTC advocates will ask what metrics or results could be provided in their efforts to achieve the same mission via BTC & at what point the BCH Podcast would concede [its many criticisms of BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc) had been misguided or insufficient. This is a very fair question.

The Podcast would switch its efforts from BCH adoption to BTC adoption if BTC advocates could demonstrate or deliver:

- BTC onboarding 100 million daily p2p cash users (without centralised or problematic workarounds)

OR

- BTC onboarding 10 million daily p2p cash users (with evidence of a feasible scaling strategy to continue another 3 orders of magnitude to 10 billion users)

In the former case, being within 2 orders of magnitude would justify the Podcast trying to help the network effect innovate some way to finish the job. In the latter case, a viable pathway would already be available & just need assistance. Note that this is quite a high bar, but it is set in accordance with the trillions of dollars of marketcap (& thus funding, legitimacy, hashrate, brand clout & more) BTC has already had to further its mission. That kind of resources should have produced far more impressive traction than has been delivered (ie. the [hijacking](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin) has been a phenomenal success). It also factors in the personal significance of dedicating The Podcast wholeheartedly to the cause.

However, there is little (and constantly decreasing) chance such a scenario ever comes to pass.

- BTC has failed to ship an upgrade since Taproot (in 2021), which [backfired on them](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/does-bch-have-ordinals) in spectacular fashion. Their current technology is not going to get the job done & they can't upgrade (due to both incompetence & [hijacking](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin)) so there's virtually zero prospect of any forward movement.
- As of July 2025, there is nobody who has a viable proposal of any kind to scale BTC (without workarounds) to 10 billion people. The previous (unfeasible) frontrunner, [Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network) has become widely derided (even within BTC circles). It has been succeeded by a new set of technological hoaxes (such as BitVM, Ark & Fedimint) which are equally unable to deliver Bitcoin payments worldwide without a variety of compromises & problems no matter how many billions in VC funding are given to them.

Although appreciated for engaging, most questioners asking after the metric needed to convince The Podcast to defect from BCH:

- Are often [immersed in propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) that they can't yet recognise.
- Don't know about or appreciate the depth of [the BTC hijacking](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin).
- Think BTC might raise the blocksize, [which it won't](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size).
- Don't realise [how many problems BTC has](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc).
- Don't realise [what factors have hindered BCH](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/if-bch-is-so-great-why-is-the-price-low) and explain its underperforming situation but far higher potential.
- Don't know [how different BCH & BTC are](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-just-btc-with-larger-blocks) or [how many things BCH already has that BTC wants](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-does-btc-already-have-what-btc-wants).
- Don't know the BCH Podcast is self aware enough to [criticise BCH](/faqs/BCH/why-not-bitcoin-cash) & [regularly criticise other BCHers](/faqs/Podcast/why-does-the-podcast-criticise-passionate-bchers).

This is not (usually) their fault, and can be hopefully corrected with [exposure to the Podcast itself](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc#unplugging--reversing-propaganda). Hopefully any BTC advocates reading this article will likewise give thought to what metrics BCH could hit to justify their defection & hold true to that committment when it happens! We could [always use your help](/faqs/BCH/how-can-i-contribute-to-bitcoin-cash)!
