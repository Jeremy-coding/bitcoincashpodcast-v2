title: But Bitcoin isn't about technology?
---

~

Their argument is that Bitcoin is primarily an *economic* innovation (facilitated by or in combination with its technical aspects), not a technological one. By this line of reasoning, the primary value of BTC comes from factors such as:

- Monetary properties:
- **History**: including the non-replicable initial distribution by Proof of Work to a world , inactive & non-profiting founder Satoshi Nakamoto
- **"Ossification"/Stability**: ~
- Network effect & liquidity: ~

In this framing technological improvements are non-essential curiosities, best limited to critical bug fixes or otherwise of secondary importance to this "foundation as good money". In their view, the BCH community is foolish to spend so much time & effort ~. Even if such efforts produce something interesting or useful, it can never outweigh the "economic factors" that drive interest in BTC.
