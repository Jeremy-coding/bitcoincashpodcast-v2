_If you're told the lie enough times, it becomes part of your reality. And if enough people are taught that lie, it [becomes part of the culture](/faqs/Culture/what-is-bitcoin-maximalism)._

Since the dawn of time, people (especially powerful interest groups) have used propaganda to create advantageous false beliefs among people who would otherwise be a threat to their position. Bitcoin is a severe [threat to government](/start#episode-5-of-10-government) & [banks](/start#episode-6-of-10-banks), so it is no surprise they [enacted a huge campaign of propaganda](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash) to suppress & delay it. A vast array of overlapping lies, half-truths, misunderstandings & misinformation was created as part of the *deliberate* attack on Bitcoin which was recognised by big blockers (now BCH) in [The Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). It successfully [rebranded Bitcoin](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand) in the minds of the general public & created a culture on the small-block (now BTC) side which has perpetuated & reinforced this panopoly of false information. This attack was (& still is) performed through concerted [censorship](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc) of the truth. Note that not everyone involved in the fallout is malicious, most are simply naive or misinformed, but a small group of malicious actors is sufficient to create a self-perpetuating flywheel of false beliefs among a much larger rabble.

A complete list of these misconceptions is nearly impossible, but a good start is the [BCH vs BTC section of the Podcast FAQs](/faqs#bitcoin-cash-bch-vs-bitcoin-btc). Note that this is the largest section of the FAQs, larger even than the [section about Bitcoin Cash itself](/faqs#bitcoin-cash-bch). This should give some indication of the scale of the problem.

## Notable propaganda

Some of the most frequent recurring misconceptions or partially-valid-but-overapplied dismissals include:

- **Security**: BCH is lambasted as insecure due to low hashrate, which has a grain of truth but overstates the issue by ignoring almost all of the surrounding context. See [Is low hashrate a problem?
](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-low-hashrate-a-problem).
- **"The market has spoken"**: A pithy dismissal with no logical validity. See: [Hasn't BTC already won? Hasn't "the market spoken"?](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/hasnt-btc-already-won).
- **Poor price performance**: A variation of "The market has spoken" which attacks BCH's market performance without [acknowledging or considering the unique circumstances](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/if-bch-is-so-great-why-is-the-price-low) involved in BCH's trading history.
- **"Big blocks can't scale"**: A critical misconception which misunderstands [Bitcoin's design & BCH's Layer 1 scaling strategy](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency). An obsession with avoiding scaling to preserve "home nodes" is driven by aforementioned [censorship](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc) & propaganda or [psychology](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency#btc-node-operator-psychology) rather than engineering.
- **"Bitcoin scales in layers"**: A misused analogy to Internet networking with no understanding of the subject matter. See: [Doesn't Bitcoin scale in layers?
](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/doesnt-bitcoin-scale-in-layers)
- **Lightning Network (or other L2s) will solve or has solved scaling**: An excuse to avoid [discussion of L1 scaling increases](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency), and doesn't hold up to detailed analysis. See: [What about the Lightning Network?](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network)

## Unplugging / reversing propaganda

<img src={reconsiderUrl} alt="People rarely reconsider their biases" />

_The human mind is well-equipped with all manner of rationalisations & cope to protect its existing belief set, even in the face of overwhelming new evidence._

Disabusing / unplugging deeply entrenched BTC coiners is very difficult because of the large extent to which they have been programmed with a wide variety of interrelated misconceptions. They also have many [valid criticisms](/faqs/BCH/why-not-bitcoin-cash) of Bitcoin Cash, so sorting through, distinguishing & addressing each true or false topic is an arduous & time consuming process. It's very difficult to create the holistic paradigm shift necessary unless the subject is open-minded & motivated (which they often are not) to improve their own Bitcoin education - for example, by carefully reading through the Bitcoin Cash Podcast FAQs. This is a real shame, but it is a problem the BCH community has relentlessly persisted in attempting to address, despite [equally relentless vilification](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-do-btc-coiners-have-such-a-specific-vendetta-against-bch). 

The good news is that the majority of the [global population](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency) are not thoroughly immersed in so many false beliefs so they come to Bitcoin (Cash) with an open mind. The most heavily propagandized BTC adopters who cannot see reason will unfortunately be harshly confronted by reality with a [BCH Flippening](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/can-bch-flip-btc).
