title: Is a 1MB limit needed to "increase creativity"?

No.

One of the common last-resort objections to [Bitcoin Cash's scaling plan](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency) by BTC supporters is that [a 1MB limit](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size) is not just an unfortunate technological hinderance, it's actually **beneficial** in that it mandates engineers to be "more creative" in finding ways to increase Bitcoin's scalability. If Bitcoin can simply [scale the blocksize](/faqs/BCH/what-is-the-maximum-bch-blocksize), isn't that "taking the easy way out" & reducing the motivation for engineers to think innovatively & find other efficient ways to improve Bitcoin scaling?

It is true that imposing constraints increases human creativity. This is a known element of human psychology. For instance if given a blank piece of paper and asked to simply draw most people will sit in confusion feeling a total lack of ideas. However, if prompted to "draw a picture of a house" then suddenly they are full of inspiration & pen immediately goes to paper.

That said, there is **no need to add artificial constraints for problems hard enough to already be constrained by reality**. 

- If asked to climb Mt Everest, would anyone say "Please cut off my leg first so that I can be more creative in figuring out how to do it?" 
- Would any rocket engineers decide they must ONLY use wood (no metal) to build their Mars rocket in order to increase their creativity? 
- Does any music artist decide they can only use 2 notes to compose a #1 Billboard song? 

When the problem itself is not trivial, there is absolutely no need to make it any more difficult than it already is - there's plenty of constraints imposed by available resources or physics to drive creativity in finding a solution.

[Scaling Bitcoin](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency) to [global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency) is already a monumentally difficult task. The Bitcoin Cash community is already under extreme constraints in terms of the available time, money, human capital, software, hardware & more (so of course we'd love it [if you'd like to help out!](/faqs/BCH/how-can-i-contribute-to-bitcoin-cash)). The difficulty of changing the opinion & financial habits of billions of people is more than enough to fill Bitcoiners lives with creativity-inducing constraints & obstacles.

The nonsensical belief that global adoption of Bitcoin is too easy & needs an arbitrary 1MB limit is of course the result of [propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) & needing to find excuses for [failing ideas like the Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network).

Note also that anyone who thinks it's the easy way out should simply [try advocating to raise the 1MB BTC limit](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size) & discover for themselves whether it's a trivial task or not. There's [plenty of problems with BTC](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc) to drive their creativity.
