_Look, a BTC block larger than 1MB! Counter to common intuition, this is not the result of an honest BTC blocksize increase, but rather the usual kind of trickery that typifies everything about the [BTC hoax](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc)._

No, although it is possible for BTC to have blocks larger than 1MB. 

During [The Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), the main contentious issue was around whether or not to increase the limited 1 MB of blocksize available in each block. The contention resulted in a [chain split](/faqs/Decentralisation/what-is-a-soft-hard-fork) producing both BCH & BTC.

- BCH increased the blocksize to 8MB (albeit sacrificing the ticker symbol and [brand](/faqs/BCH/will-bitcoin-cash-rebrand) in the process), then later moved to 32 MB & finally [the ABLA adjustable limit](/faqs/BCH/what-is-the-maximum-bch-blocksize).
- BTC did NOT increase the blocksize, but adopted an upgrade called "SegWit" which changed the accounting for bytes of on-chain transactions. BTC blocks must still fit under an (unchanged) 1MB blocksize limit, but can have up to 4 MB of total "block weight" data (although it's not really the same as 4MB of normal blocksize, since it can only reach that size with [Inscriptions](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/does-bch-have-ordinals) & the limit in terms of "regular transactions" caps out at around 2.1 MB). This type of unintuitive trickery & nonsense is typical of the [BTC hijacking](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin), as can also be seen in the [extensive propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc), [censorship](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-censorship-in-btc), [red herring scaling technologies](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network) & [other BTC problems](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc).

This did allow for larger blocks (within limits) but was not a "blocksize increase" in the traditional & intuitive sense of the world.

However, this confusion supports the common piece of propaganda that "BTC already increased the blocksize with SegWit". This is used to confuse the issue of the BCH & BTC split by claimining that ""both sides"" did a ""blocksize increase"". This is deliberately or ignorantly misleading, either:

- Conflating terminology (blocksize/weight) to give the impression that BTC could easily raise the real blocksize limit ([which they can't](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size)).
- Moving the debate to pedantic semantics to [obscure the truth about BTC becoming hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin).
- Pretending that the ONLY issue of The Blocksize War was the blocksize limit, when rather it was the focal point encompassing a [debate with ramifications](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc) for the projects' direction technically, socially, economically & philosophically. This is why BCH & BTC are [different & increasingly diverging](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-bch-just-btc-with-larger-blocks) today.

All of this is just talking around the fact that BTC did not increase the actual blocksize limit that was under contention, and as a result does not reflect on all the larger issues at play (even if BTC does now have blocks larger on disk than 1MB). The increase in capacity which did occur is an irrelevant blip in the race to become [the global reserve currency](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency).
