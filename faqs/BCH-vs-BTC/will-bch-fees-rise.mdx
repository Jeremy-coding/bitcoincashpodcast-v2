title: Will BCH fees rise? Aren't BCH fees low due to low transaction volume? Won't rising volume / price increase fees?
---

No.

Many people, particularly BTC proponents, believe that BCH's current sub-cent fees are simply a result of low transaction volume. They argue that if BCH demand grows comparable to BTC, fees will have to rise. They believe BCH's low fees are a result of low demand, rather than superior engineering & correct economic design.

This is incorrect. BCH has low fees because blockspace supply is not artificially restricted. Demand higher or lower than BTC is irrelevant, what matters is demand lower than BCH blockspace, which is far higher than on BTC and will be further increased over time. Fees would only rise if BCH demand was constantly overflowing its own available blockspace (as it is on BTC), which would require an order of magnitude more demand than BTC (because BCH has more than an order of magnitude more capacity today, and even more in future). By increasing blocksize (capacity / supply) ahead of transaction volume demand & allowing the mempool to clear in each block (or, infrequently at spikes of enormous network demand, within only a few blocks), BCH can maintain low fees set by miner commodity costs of storage space rather than by consumer competition to prioritise their transaction within artificially limited blockspace.

This is not just theory, it has been validated in practice. On several occassions, BCH has processed more daily transactions than BTC - and fees have not even flickered above their typical sub-cent costs. If this direct evidence is not enough, note that the same thing can be observed on many other cryptocurrency blockchains, such as [Litecoin](/faqs/Cryptocurrency/what-about-litecoin-ltc) or BSV.

As BCH continues its [rise to global reserve currency](/faqs/Podcast/what-do-you-mean-global-reserve-currency), ~~.
