title: Does BCH have Ordinals / Inscriptions / BRC-20 tokens like Bitcoin BTC?

No, but it has [CashTokens](/faqs/Tech/what-is-cashtokens) which is way better.

The accidental discovery of a Taproot exploit allowing Ordinals, Inscriptions & BRC-20 tokens on BTC has created enormous confusion and controversy within its own community. The BCH community resisted the prerequisite implementation of SegWit (it was one of the contentious issues [in the Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash)) and split away at the same moment SegWit was integrated into BTC. BCH also does not have the Taproot ""upgrade"" added to BTC in 2021. These changes were rejected by the BCH community for their poor engineering choices, which in hindsight has proven very wise.

Instead, the BCH community have deliberately developed a superior system called [CashTokens](/faqs/Tech/what-is-cashtokens) which covers much of the same market requirements (plus a LOT more!) without technical workarounds or community contention.
