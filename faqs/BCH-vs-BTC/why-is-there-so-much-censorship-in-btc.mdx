_Censorship is an implicit admission to conceding the intellectual debate._

Fast spreading adoption of Bitcoin from 2009 to 2015 was only derailed by the suspicious imposition of [massive censorship during the Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). These issues have been [well documented](/recommended#history). However, the censorship was overall incredibly effective & has led to many BTC believers having strong opinions (and misconceptions) about Bitcoin because they have never seen or explored an open discussion of alternative arguments.

Along with explicit censorship, there is also implicit self-censorship of many BTC adopters. Many current or curious Bitcoin adopters - who very reasonably are interested in experimenting with, investing in or discussing alternative cryptocurrencies - feel anxious about voicing their opinions in BTC dominated spaces for fear of lashback.

Fortunately, the truth cannot be suppressed forever. The cryptocurrency markets have diversified into many other coins to flow around BTC's bottlenecked information & the [building momentum of BCH](/faqs/BCH/is-BCH-spreading) is helping to correct a lot of misconceptions. But there is still much work to do.

For BTC adopters, this ingrained culture of censorship [is one of many significant issues with their project](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc). This echo chamber of false narratives is not merely a historical relic of the past, something the BTC community needed at the time of the Blocksize War but has "grown out of". Persistent censorship still occurs in the ecosystem as of 2023 (examples below), although thankfully [many new areas for discussion](/recommended#discussion--community) have gained prominence to address this deficit.

In tragically comedic fashion, many of the BTC-favouring individuals who cheered censorship & suppression of dissenting voices such as the BCH community are then bamboozled & outraged once their own ideas are the ones being forcibly ejected from the BTC conversation.

## Examples of ongoing censorship:

- 2nd June 2023: Dr Maxim Orlovsky highlights [censorship of scaling discussion on the Bitcoin dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-June/021733.html) and the lack of transparent moderation policy.
- May 30 2023: Vlad Costea, long time BTC Podcaster, discovers his genuine efforts to help BTC, are being blockaded by censorship. [Source](https://twitter.com/TheVladCostea/status/1663345602950832129).

- [/r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) the [original Bitcoin battleground](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), still bans and supresses discussion of Bitcoin Cash or other Bitcoin forks (try asking about it yourself!).

All cryptocurrency investors, but particularly those involved with Bitcoin Core BTC, should be very diligent about ensuring they engage with a diverse range of cryptocurrency media and do not fall into an ideologically captured echo chamber.

_Be very careful that correct ideas don't become dismissed due to a bias against the source explaining it. [Source](https://twitter.com/kzKallisti/status/1667225334058459138)._
