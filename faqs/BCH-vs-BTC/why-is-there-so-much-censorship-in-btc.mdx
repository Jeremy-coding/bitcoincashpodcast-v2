_Censorship is an implicit admission to conceding the intellectual debate._

Fast spreading adoption of Bitcoin from 2009 to 2015 was only derailed by the suspicious imposition of [massive censorship during the Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). These issues have been [well documented](/recommended#history). However, the censorship was overall incredibly effective & has led to many BTC believers having strong opinions (including a lot of [misconceptions & propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc)) about Bitcoin because they have never seen or explored an open discussion of alternative arguments. This was a part of [the Bitcoin hijacking](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin).

:::tip

Along with explicit censorship, there is also implicit self-censorship of many BTC adopters. Many current or curious Bitcoin adopters - who very reasonably are interested in experimenting with, investing in or discussing alternative cryptocurrencies - feel anxious about voicing their opinions in BTC dominated spaces for fear of lashback (e.g. from [toxic maximalists](/faqs/Culture/what-is-bitcoin-maximalism#btc-toxic-maximalism)). Others who have built their social capital, financial position, reputation, platform or ego upon propagating these lies are of course heavily disincentivised to acknowledge, discuss or contribute to debunking the multitide of falsehoods involved in their position.

:::

Fortunately, the truth cannot be suppressed forever. The cryptocurrency markets have diversified into many other coins to flow around BTC's bottlenecked information & the [building momentum of BCH](/faqs/BCH/is-BCH-spreading) is helping to correct a lot of misconceptions. But there is still much work to do.

For BTC adopters, this ingrained culture of censorship [is one of many significant issues with their project](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc). This echo chamber of false narratives is not merely a historical relic of the past, something the BTC community needed at the time of the Blocksize War but has "grown out of". Persistent censorship still occurs in the ecosystem as of 2025 (examples below), although thankfully [many new areas for discussion](/recommended#discussion--community) have gained prominence to address this deficit.

In tragically comedic fashion, many of the BTC-favouring individuals who cheered censorship & suppression of dissenting voices such as the BCH community are then bamboozled & outraged once their own ideas are the ones being forcibly ejected from the BTC conversation.

## Examples of ongoing censorship:

- 2nd June 2023: Dr Maxim Orlovsky highlights [censorship of scaling discussion on the Bitcoin dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-June/021733.html) and the lack of transparent moderation policy.
- May 30 2023: Vlad Costea, long time BTC Podcaster, discovers his genuine efforts to help BTC, are being blockaded by censorship. [Source](https://twitter.com/TheVladCostea/status/1663345602950832129).

- [/r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) the [original Bitcoin battleground](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), still bans and supresses discussion of Bitcoin Cash or other Bitcoin forks (try asking about it yourself!).

- 30th October 2023: Antoine Riard, prominent Lightning Network & Bitcoin Core developer, finds himself censored for his opinions around technical proogress under questionable circumstances. [Stacker News Source](https://stacker.news/items/298135)

- In 2021, after a thorough debate destruction by Kim Dotcom, a group of BTC advocates from Swan Bitcoin edited their own Youtube recordings to try cover up their embarassingly weak arguments. However the clip was [preserved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxXkZdEUA8c) by the BCH community and [subsequently appeared in the 2022 Podcast intro](/faqs/Podcast/what-are-the-intro-references#2022-intro). A [complete review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE9aE9rFSUs) with commentary of the original debate was also conducted on The Bitcoin Cash Podcast itself. In January of 2024, the same guys couldn't believe their own words (which they had self-censored from their own channel) because of how ridiculous their arguments seemed even to them in hindsight.

- In 2025, as part of the [Filterooors vs "Spam" war](/episodes/151) & [collapsing hoax](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc), small blocker infighting reaches the point that they begin to give each other a taste of their own medicine. "Filters"/Knots supporters are dismayed to discover manipulation of the Github repository & Reddit forums to suppress their opinions & create a fake narrative.  Of course these tactics are very familiar to the BCH community.

This suppression continued throughout 2025:

The censorship cuts both ways, as by late 2025, the Knots brigade are desperately trying to censor their Core opposition in retribution.

As Epstein documents came out in Feb 2026, confirming the BTC hijacking, suppression was of course in full force to prevent any spread of the several prominent BTC figures involved in such shady dealings.

## Ideological Rigour & Diversity

All cryptocurrency investors, but particularly those involved with Bitcoin Core BTC, should be very diligent about ensuring they engage with a diverse range of cryptocurrency media and do not fall into an ideologically captured echo chamber.

_Be very careful that correct ideas don't become dismissed due to a bias against the source explaining it. [Source](https://twitter.com/kzKallisti/status/1667225334058459138)._
