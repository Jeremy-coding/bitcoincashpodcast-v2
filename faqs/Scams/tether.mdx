By reading the [Start guide](/start), it should be clear that "stablecoins" (cryptocurrencies pegged to government fiat currencies through a central redeemer) are not only generally risky (as the redeemer can default, unlike free floating cryptocurrencies) but often outright scams.

The largest stablecoin, and the biggest scam is called Tether, which has massively inflated the overall cryptocurrency market value.

See the following videos for more information:

A collapse of Tether is a large risk for the entire cryptocurrency markets, as I explain here:

Note that such an event would rock all of crypto, but BCH should be slightly better protected than most due to its obsessive focus on educating end users and building real peer-to-peer trade links (and not financial speculation).
