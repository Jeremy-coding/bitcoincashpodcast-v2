title: Does Bitcoin Cash have a roadmap?
---

No, although anyone is free to make one.

Bitcoin Cash is [decentralised](/faqs/Decentralisation/how-does-BCH-governance-work), so there is no central party who could create a roadmap that had any authority. If anyone did create a roadmap, its authority would be limited to the willingness of the rest of the ecosystem to adhere to it.

Instead, the [CHIP process](/faqs/Decentralisation/how-does-BCH-governance-work), helps to co-ordinate network upgrades in the upcoming yearly cycle.

There is nothing preventing individual community members from trying to aggregate or clarify the state of BCH development in their own **non-authoritative** roadmap, as per [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast Roadmap](/roadmap). However such efforts seem to stagnate because they are high effort to maintain and produce little value. This isn't a problem, just an organic discovery of the best process for Bitcoin Cash to develop.
