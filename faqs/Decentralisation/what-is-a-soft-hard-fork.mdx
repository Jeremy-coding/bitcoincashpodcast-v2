_Diagram of Bitcoin forks & splits to June 2023. Note that Bitcoin underwent both hard & soft forks before its initial chain split to BTC/BCH. Diagram is periodically updated by [Reddit user lugaxker](https://www.reddit.com/user/lugaxker/submitted/)._

A hard fork is **NOT** a chain-split. This is a VERY common misconception (or piece of [propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc)). The difference is explained below.

:::

New entrants to cryptocurrency are often confused & bamboozled by terminology around soft/hard forks. As a finnicky, technical topic specific to cryptocurrency it is very common for the exact nuances to be misunderstood. A large part of the confusion is that a third phenomon, called a "chain split" is often erroneously conflated with a hard fork. 

It is essential to understand a chain split before clarifying soft vs hard forks.

## Chain split

A "chain split" is when a fork (_either_ a hard-fork OR a soft-fork) causes a single blockchain to split into two separate coins. Most famously, this occured in [The Blocksize War](/) between BTC & BCH, but it also happened when BCH split again in the BCH/BSV split in late 2018 and also the BCH/XEC split in late 2020. Splitting is not unique to Bitcoin - it can happen on any blockchain, as with the ETH/ETC split - but there are no notable splits outside of those cases. Only Bitcoin & Ethereum have historically had sufficiently sized communities to mean a disputing minority is significant enough to create & sustain the conditions for two indepent coins to emerge from one.

The determining factor in whether a (hard or soft) fork causes a split is not the fork itself, it is whether there is **enough community controversy/contention for a substantial minority to protest the proposed changes**. The reason for a chain-split is **social, not technical**. If there is sufficient disagreement before an upcoming fork, one or both camps within a single cryptocurrency may battle over control of the chain (with either one or both sides proposing a set of controversial desired changes). As a unique kind of non-violent, social consensus based warfare only possible in cryptocurrencies there is not a truly well-established set of norms governing these kinds of conflicts, however in general it is true that:

- The battleground is a combination of in-person conferences & meetups in addition to community debate online. This political dispute may or may not escalate to direct economic/cryptographic warfare via (Bitcoin/Ethereum) [miners](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/is-low-hashrate-a-problem). There are no current chain splits that have emerged from Proof of Stake.
- A dispute ~.
- The winning side of the conflict retains the brand name, icon & exchange ticker of the pre-split chain. This is an enormous victory because the network effect of branding, technical integrations & exchange-traded liquidity is incredibly powerful.
- The losing side of the conflict is forced into choosing a new name, icon & ticker symbol (starting from no exchange liquidity). Having to rebuild these assets/network effect from scratch is incredibly taxing to the losing side & leads to poor price performance of their coin relative to the winner (at least in the medium term).
- The aggreived losing side will often set out to reclaim marketplace dominance over their former compatriots with a Flippening. This dynamic will likely lead to [ongoing resentment](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-do-btc-coiners-have-such-a-specific-vendetta-against-bch) on both sides of the conflict.

## Hard forks

A hard-fork is **a non-backwards compatible upgrade to a cryptocurrency**. In other words, it can add, remove OR change consensus rules to the network of validating nodes.

A hard-fork *may* lead to a chain-split (creation of two coins), but it is *not REQUIRED to*. Hard forks & chain splits are *related but separate* concepts. A cryptocurrency can hard fork without splitting **if there is no community contention**.

The original Bitcoin hard-forked in 

The Bitcoin Cash community does a [yearly hard fork network upgrade](/), co-ordinated through the [CHIP Process](/faqs/Decentralisation/how-does-BCH-governance-work).

## Soft forks

A soft-fork is a ~~.
