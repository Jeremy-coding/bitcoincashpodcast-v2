_Everything in engineering is tradeoffs. Only incompetent engineers would choose the sub-optimal tradeoffs at the far left & right of the spectrum. [Source](https://twitter.com/MKjrstad/status/1736042838398271595)._

If carefully managed, blocksize increases do not centralise nodes. If handled irresponsibly, yes they absolutely will.

:::tip

"Nodes" in the [Bitcoin whitepaper](/bitcoin.pdf) referred exclusively to mining nodes (at Bitcoin's inception, there was no such thing as non-mining nodes). Over time this meaning has become more generalised and the term "node" in general parlance now signifies a network node with a full copy of the blockchain (a "full node"), whether it is a miner or not. It is this sense of "full node" which is being referred to in this article.

## Contention over Nodes

One of the key points of contention between BCH & BTC supporters is the role of Bitcoin nodes in the network. This topic was heavily debated [during the Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash) & remains an ongoing area of frequent [BTC propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc).

In general, each side has the following attitude towards nodes:

- **BCH:** End-users may or may not run a node, the key point of Bitcoin being that they can use it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash currency [with cheap fees](/faqs/BCH/will-bch-fees-rise). Nodes should be run by miners, exchanges, large BCH-accepting merchants, developers, BCH wallet/infrastructure providers & enthusiastic hobbyists. Node costs must be balanced against other considerations such as ~~. Node costs are naturally subsized by [ongoing improvement in computer hardware](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency#scaling-pillar-2-hardware-innovation), can also be mitigated with technical development of [pruned nodes](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency#scaling-pillar-3-pruned-nodes). 
- **BTC:** Nodes should be run by the maximum possible number of end-users. This is the priority concern of the network (resilience to attack & sovereignty of end users) & is worth maintaining a static blocksize limit. To many BTC supporters, it is even more important that users can afford to run a node than be able to afford to make Bitcoin transactions. Non-institutional Bitcoin end-users should look to alternatives like [the Lightning Network](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-about-lightning-network) if they want to use Bitcoin as a currency.

## Nodes & Decentralisation

More nodes is better when it comes to decentralising a cryptocurrency, but it also has diminishing returns. The difference between 10 & 11 nodes run by separate entities is significant (approximately 10% harder to shut down the entire network, greater network connectivity & so on), but the difference between 100 000 & 100 001 is quite marginal. Past a threshold of redundancy / resilience to attack, the benefit of additional nodes is limited.



Note that nodes are far from the only factor in establishing decentralisation of a cryptocurrency. 

## What's the correct blocksize?

Amazingly, through the BTC/BCH chain split & later the BCH/BSV chain split, Bitcoin history has provided real-world examples of three different approaches to scaling blocksize & the tradeoffs of each option.

### Blocks just right - BCH

Bitcoin Cash adopts a "moderate" strategy to increasing blocks. It allows gradually increasing block sizes over time to accomodate improving technology. This process is managed by [the ABLA algorithm](/faqs/BCH/what-is-the-maximum-bch-blocksize) to ensure growth remains responsive to real demand & within the bounds of improving technology. This gives infrastructure operators (miners, full nodes, wallet services, block explorers, exchanges & other businesses) clear guidance to plan their operation resources for the present & foreseeable future. In addition, ABLA replaces the need for the BCH community to periodically discuss, debate & co-ordinate blocksize increases.

### Blocks too small - BTC

Maintaing a static blocksize ~~.

Some BTC supporters may believe that the BTC blocksize is not fixed & "can be easily raised when necessary", but [nothing could be further from the truth](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size). Until demonstrated by an unlikely & surprising turn of history, the status quo will constantly entrench BTC as a 1MB chain.


### Blocks too large - BSV
