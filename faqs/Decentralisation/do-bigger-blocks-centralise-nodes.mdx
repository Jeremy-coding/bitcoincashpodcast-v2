_Diagram of Bitcoin forks & splits to June 2023. Note that Bitcoin underwent both hard & soft forks before its initial chain split to BTC/BCH. Diagram is periodically updated by [Reddit user lugaxker](https://www.reddit.com/user/lugaxker/submitted/)._

If carefully managed, no. If handled irresponsibly, absolutely yes.


## What's the correct blocksize?

Amazingly, through the BTC/BCH chain split & later the BCH/BSV chain split, Bitcoin history has provided real-world examples of three different approaches to scaling blocksize & the tradeoffs of each option.

### Blocks just right - BCH

Bitcoin Cash adopts a "moderate" strategy to increasing blocks. It allows gradually increasing block sizes over time to accomodate improving technology. This process is managed by [the ABLA algorithm](/faqs/BCH/what-is-the-maximum-bch-blocksize) to ensure growth remains responsive to real demand & within the bounds of improving technology. This gives infrastructure operators (miners, full nodes, wallet services, block explorers, exchanges & other businesses) clear guidance to plan their operation resources for the present & foreseeable future. In addition, ABLA replaces the need for the BCH community to periodically discuss, debate & co-ordinate blocksize increases.

### Blocks too small - BTC

Maintaing a static blocksize ~~.

Some BTC supporters may believe that the BTC blocksize is not fixed & "can be easily raised when necessary", but [nothing could be further from the truth](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/what-if-btc-raises-block-size). Until demonstrated by an unlikely & surprising turn of history, the status quo will constantly entrench BTC as a 1MB chain.


### Blocks too large - BSV
