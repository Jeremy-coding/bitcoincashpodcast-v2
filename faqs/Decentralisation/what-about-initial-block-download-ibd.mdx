title: What about Initial Block Download (IBD)?
---

Many people, once they [hear about Bitcoin's big block scaling strategy](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency), become concerned about the need to run nodes and preserve its decentralisation. If the blockchain size grows continually (& potentially exponentially), won't it become potentially impossible to synchronise new nodes (to replace or augment the existing set) - thus eventually centralising the system? This particular concern - the time & difficulty required to synchronise a new node from other existing nodes already running on the network - is called Initial Block Download (IBD).

Of course, [nodes are important for decentralisation](/faqs/Decentralisation/is-bitcoin-cash-decentralised#node-count), although [bigger blocks do not need to reduce the amount of nodes](/faqs/Decentralisation/do-bigger-blocks-centralise-nodes). Initial block download is something the BCH community must keep in mind, but fortunately it is not as simple as "bigger blocks = terrible or infeasible IBD". There are a variety of technologies & mitigating factors which allow for a bigger blocksize without sacrificing the feasibility of IBD.

# UTXO Commitments

The primary technology ~ is called "UTXO Commitments". By embedding a hash of the UTXO set at a given blockheight inside the coinbase of a block, miners can vouch with their proof of work . This proof accumulates over time, as with security of transactions, confirmation by confirmation.

UTXO Commitment concepts have been discussed since the early 2010s, but interest and development died down because of [the Blocksize War](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash). The small block side limited their blocks to small throughput thus abrogating any need to improve their scalability ([at great cost](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/whats-wrong-with-bitcoin-btc)), and the big block side ~. Nevertheless, UTXO Commitments has remained in the minds of the BCH community, and as of mid-2025 is being [actively researched](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-07-utxo-fastsync/502/87) and [discussed](https://read.cash/@GeneralProtocols/gps-view-on-the-current-chip-landscape-9732dd18#utxo-commitment).

# Software improvements

The BCH community has been able to massively speed up UTXO set management (among other things) by improving the node software, for instance with the [UTXO-Z initiative](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/utxo-z-release/1658). As with UTXO commitments, this is an ongoing effort in both research & implementation which multiplies with the improvements offered by UTXO Commitments, better hardware, better node pruning etc.

This can be particularly confusing for BTC adopters, as the [hijacked](/faqs/Media/what-about-roger-vers-book-hijacking-bitcoin) status of the Bitcoin Core development team or the [surrounding propaganda](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-is-there-so-much-propaganda-in-btc) has taught them (incorrectly) that they have world-leading experts producing world-leading software which is duly optimised as well as can be. None of that is true. Superior node development teams & implementations is just one of the many things [BCH already has that BTC wants](/faqs/BCH-vs-BTC/why-does-btc-already-have-what-btc-wants).

# Hardware improvements & Pruned Nodes

As with every part of the big block scaling startegy, [hardware improvements](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency#scaling-pillar-2-hardware-innovation) and [pruned nodes](/faqs/Global-Reserve-Currency/can-BCH-technically-scale-to-global-reserve-currency#scaling-pillar-3-pruned-nodes) do a lot to mitigate the impact of increasing blockchain traffic on initial block download.
