Welcome to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community!

Episode 1 of the podcast begins "in the middle of the story" so to speak and may be initially very confusing, so it is highly recommended to understand the history of Bitcoin/Cash first. The best ways to do this are [read the Start Guide](/start), particularly the [section on Bitcoin Cash](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), and/or watch the excellent documentary ["Who Killed Bitcoin?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc) (English version narrated by [Jeremy from The Bitcoin Cash Podcast](/about))!

For those entirely new to crypto, a good starting point is the Bitcoin BTC vs Bitcoin Cash BCH series, which covers the essential points of difference and thereby serves as an introduction to cryptocurrency as a whole.

Other recommended episodes to get the maximum possible overview of cryptocurrency and BCH in under 5 hours include [Episode 17](/docs/17) and then [Episode 15](/docs/15).
