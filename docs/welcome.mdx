Welcome to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community!

Completionists may like to start with [Episode 1](/docs/1), although it picks up the thread "in the middle of the story" so to speak and may be initially quite confusing. In most cases, it is better to come back to this episode once more acquainted with cryptocurrency.

For those entirely new to crypto, a good starting point is the Bitcoin BTC vs Bitcoin Cash BCH series, which covers the essential points of difference and thereby serves as an introduction to cryptocurrency as a whole.

For those who want to get the maximum possible overview of cryptocurrency and BCH in under 5 hours, I recommend listening to [Episode 17](/docs/17) and then [Episode 15](/docs/15).
