Welcome to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community!

Episode 1 of the podcast begins "in the middle of the story" so to speak and may be initially very confusing. Instead, the best episode to start with is Episode 85, which covers all the foundations of Bitcoin Cash & what the Podcast is about. This general overview provides enough context that listeners can then carry on from Episode 1, or the most recent episode, or any other starting point that catches their interest.

After that, other ways to dive deeper on the history and fundamentals of Bitcoin/Cash. [Read the Start Guide](/start), particularly the [section on Bitcoin Cash](/start#episode-8-of-10-bitcoin-cash), and/or watch the excellent documentary ["Who Killed Bitcoin?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc) (English version narrated by [Jeremy from The Bitcoin Cash Podcast](/about))!
