# Flipstarter: Episodes 116 - 125 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 24 BCH (~$485 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 116 - 125. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

## Notes

### Impact

The Podcast social media growth has accelerated. 30 day audio downloads have recently been at ATHs (~1700 downloads / 30 day window), which is higher than the previous peak of ~1600 set when BCH was having its mid-2022 CoinFlex drama. Interest is higher now than it was then, but this time based on sustainable positive momentum rather than temporary drama disaster. Similar growth is visible on other platforms, now past 2 100 Youtube subscribers & 8 500 Twitter followers. Also growing but clear room for improvement on TikTok & Instagram, which will be part of my focus over the coming months. The podcast has historically not done great on short form content, being an information dense hub for hardcore BCH supporters, but that's an area we can now address. The ABLA Explainer video was very popular so that might be one inspiration to follow on from.

## Note to the community

The snowball is rolling. BCH is already leading the cryptocurrency industry on a number of metrics, and just as importantly the industry is becoming aware of it. Eyes are turning onto BCH & the impressive results of several years hard work are getting some appreciation. Take the time to enjoy this, but also realise the burden now falls on us to outdo expectations again to jump up to the next level. Areas of decentralised governance, UTXO tech & merchant adoption are strengths we should continue building, but we also have obvious lacking areas in physical meetups/conferences, community size, promotional reach & privacy that can do with some polish.

BLISS was a huge success with everyone attending in person & a moderate success with livestream viewers. For a first outing, I'm very pleased. We took a lot of feedback & learnt a bunch of lessons - those will be reflected on over the next little while.

Finally, CBDCs and tyranny is starting to arrive in earnest. We've known this was coming & that we'd get relatively little help from the rest of the crypto industry in providing workable solutions. So the urgency is as high as it's ever been. I'm hoping with our increased networking & growing traction we can make a big surge over the next 6 months & arrive at 2025 looking set to start seriously dominating the industry next year.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous 4 Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a new page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

## Cost breakdown:

- 0.6 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 0.6 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.1 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.1 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.1 BCH Youtube Shorts creation & distribution
- 0.2 BCH Instagram & TikTok videos & management

1.7 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 17 BCH

4 BCH: Media materials for experimental prototype projects & additional videos such as BLISS interviews / music videos for increased BCH promotion.
3 BCH misc expenses: Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, Zoom subscription, supporting other community Flipstarters, FAQ maintenance etc..

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason. Missed out on shoutouts in the 1 already delivered episode, but I'm sure faster delivery is preferable anyway.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. If funding stops I will eventually have to work harder on alternative monetisation strategies (possibly advertising, sponsored episodes) though.
