# Flipstarter: Episodes 76 - 85 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 20 BCH (~$125 / BCH)

## Deliverable

Episodes 76 - 85. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

**NOTE:** I will be completing these episodes whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show is in no way contingent on this funding request. See Rationale for further details.

All prior delivery funded by:

- My own savings (initially)
- The incredible support of anonymous donations (thank you, especially to some of the larger contributors, it makes a titanic difference)
- My 2 Patrons (Ricky & HP)
- A tiny bit of Twitch/Youtube ad/subscription revenue
- Prompt.cash early-access unlocks (now discontinued)
- Our new sponsor General Protocols.

## Rationale:

I am slowly expanding and exploring ways to monetise the show, because although I love BCH it does take a ton of work and everyone involved should be compensated. My goal is to build up to supporting myself and the other show contributors full time as a sustainable business. Flipstarter is one element of that strategy which seemed heavily underused. Although this Flipstarter money is not necessary to continue running the show as it is, the math is pretty simple that the more funding the show receives the more time I (and others) can justify allocating to it, the more the quality can be improved and the more breathing room I have for more varied and ambitious BCH related projects.

In the past I have been leery of running a Flipstarter, believing it would be a crutch to avoid finding other methods of monetisation. In addition, the community has also been low on resources, with price declines, CoinFlex scams & more so I didn't want to draw from an already strained pool of community funding.

What changed is my confidence in the maturity of the show plus progress on other sources of revenue. The show has been running for over 2 years. We've now accumulated the necessary gear so that the production quality isn't amateur. The show gets regular positive feedback from happy listeners. Other crypto communities are starting to notice and request collaborations. New episodes rank highly on BCH Reddit. The show doesn't need funding to continue this kind of output, but if those costs were handled then it frees up time and capital for other things (no promises or previews, but take it on faith that I have some good ideas).

I also hope to continue and encourage a BCH culture of smaller Flipstarters, forming a tighter loop between funding and delivery thus raising accountability for regular community contributors. Campaigns funded for technical delivery on average seem to be producing results. But one of the pitfalls of Flipstarter so far seems to have been BCH community funding large promotional projects with grand promises, that then fail to deliver and/or fail to live up to the expectations of many funders and/or non-funders. This problem can be avoided by demonstrating that long running or more ambitious projects (as promotional stuff tends to be) can be funded in stages, with further funding easily raised upon quality delivery of earlier promises. I am very confident this request has by far the best ratio of prior content delivered to funding amount desired of any promotional related Flipstarter ever and hopefully that can help to set the bar in such a way that BCH can continue attracting content creators and funding them, but also setting a high bar for proven community investment. Ideally creators are able to ask for Flipstarters at a point where the work they've done on their own initiative already justifies the further funding they need for their next project.

If this Flipstarter is well received, I am likely to repeat it with a similar request for Episodes 86 - 95.
