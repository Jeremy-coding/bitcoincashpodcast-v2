# FundMe: Episodes 156 - 165 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 17 BCH (~$520 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 156 - 165. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

## Notes

### FundMe

The BCH Podcast is going from strength to strength. Ongoing community support via FundMe, donations & Patreon plus fresh work to build up a base of sponsors for the show is creating room for the Podcast to expand and improve its stream quality constantly. Less time needs to be spent on debunking lies on Twitter & more time is going into building a BCH ecosystem that attracts attention as a byproduct of its innovative & undeniable industry leadership.

### Visibility

Podcast visibility is continuing to improve. Just about to hit 3 000 Youtube subscribers and 10 000 Twitter followers. It's very obvious that the BCH narrative in the broader "crypto" ecosystem has become unchallenged and rather unchallengeable since the ability to attack it with disinformation has so greatly decreased. Although not yet widely recognised for leading the industry, that will come as social resistance to BCH melts away in the face of growing business opportunities. The Podcast will remain a pillar of these efforts to improve BCH visibility & commercial success.

## Note to the community

2025 has been a really good year so far. I'm already looking forward to the Christmas episode recap, but we've still got 6 months to really seize the initiative and BCH to become known as a rising industry star. It all comes from everyone working as hard as they do every day and I'm so glad to be a part of it.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

## Badgers.cash

Badgers has been a strong success, recently peaking over 300 BCH TVL, with very minimal marketing & ongoing tech support. I really enjoy contributing to it with the Podcast FundMe raises as Proof of Community good will & I am still trying to encourage other ecosystem players to consider doing this too.

-- Explanation of Badgers below

I discovered that BADGER token, obtainable only by provably time-locking BCH on-chain, has traded as high as #10 on Cauldron. Speculative liquidity thus created a **native BCH yield** for time-locking BCH. This is an incredible community innovation, as it allows anyone to yield on their BCH by provably HODLing (boosting price, liquidity & thus marketing reach) and it also allows anyone to generate goodwill in the community by provably purchasing & burning BADGER. It's always been possible to "donate" to all BCH holders by burning BCH itself, but that's psychologically unappealing due to the limited supply of BCH. BADGER avoids that, is fun, generates more transactions & usage of CashTokens tech.

In order to boost Badger TVL, what is needed is some kind of non-speculative demand to buy (& ideally burn) BADGER tokens. My idea for this is that community projects can show goodwill to the community by provably burning & I'm going to start with the Podcast. As a part of this ongoing experiment, some of the desired raised funds will be used to purchase Badger on Cauldron.quest and provably burn it. Readers are more than welcome to frontrun this by purchasing BADGER, which achieves somewhat the same effect! If this caught on as a community initiative by aligned projects, it would encourage more people to lock BCH, boosting the price and bringing more resources to the community to run even more projects (which can burn more BADGER). Raising BCH on-chain TVL is one of the few ways to defeat naked short selling, Tether inflation or other manipulation of the BCH price so I am very interested in new & potentially compelling ways to encourage this.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the FundMe gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous FundMe, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. The community contributions do a lot to help the show operate in the community's best interest without compromising for financial necessity.
