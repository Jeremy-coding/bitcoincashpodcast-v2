# Flipstarter: Episodes 126 - 135 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 35 BCH ($355 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 126 - 135. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

## Notes

### FundMe

After 5 successful Flipstarters, we're now live on FundMe.cash! Huge shoutout to Sayoshi Nakamario for pushing the state of the art in BCH crowdfunding tools (a critical element of the Podcast's success) forward. Flipstarter has been absolutely fantastic, my sincere thanks to everyone who was involved in its development & maintenance - the show wouldn't be where it is without it. My hope is that FundMe will be even better by opening up to a bigger pool of donors through the easier WalletConnect flow instead of the Flipstarter EC plugin which has been a known barrier to entry for some potential past contributors. There's also potential for contributor NFT distribution & other upgrades in the near future - so things are only going to get better. As usual, it's great to see the BCH ecosystem powering forward to deliver increasingly powerful & easy to use solutions.

### Visibility

BCH momentum is really building & that's been very noticeable in running the Podcast. Recently, demand for guest slots has been higher than it ever has been by a huge margin. By the start of August, all slots for August, September & even into October were already scheduled (typically only 2 to 3 episodes would be scheduled in advance, rather than 8 or 9). This reflects both innovation within BCH & increased interest from outside. Internally, endemic projects are seeking help to get coverage & attention for their latest/upcoming exciting releases. The Podcast is more than happy to assist in this regard, it's very exciting to have an ecosystem thriving with so much productivity. Externally, the momentum in BCH is generating curiosity & engagement with the project. This is also great news & will help expose BCH to fresh audiences as a result.

We're also seeing the return of "BCH is dead" FUD. After we defeated the previous round of that, we received a period of respite where haters felt timid to come back for more. However our increasing visibility is now bringing in a fresh wave of ignorant propagandised fools to give their 2 cents that BCH is dead, ironically only because it's doing better than ever and thus caught their attention. This probably won't be the last cycle of such FUD, but every time it recurs it becomes increasingly ridiculous & I'm pleased to see the community response has been to treat it as such. Outsiders notice & get curious.

### Feedback

Listener feedback has been very positive for the recent episodes. I believe we are constantly delivering at a higher quality of discussion & I'm very glad the listener feedback seems to reflect that. Viewer metrics are not noticeably rising, but I'm not surprised given the relatively monotone BCH price action.

## Note to the community

I have been particularly excited to see the emergence of public statistics from the BCH community. Selene users can be checked on daily, AFoG is putting out statistics, BCH Bull makes regular announcements on their progress, BCH Guru has a dashboard & other projects no doubt soon to follow. This data-driven approach allows for better self-reflection & iteration on upgrades - plus it sends a very, very strong public signal that the BCH community is taking itself seriously & making progress as a result.

I'm also looking forward to the BCH Argentina conference in October. The Podcast will be in attendance & will do some on-the-ground coverage of the event - although it is not our intention to comprehensively cover the event or broadcast as much as possible like at BLISS. Attending is about being involved in what's happening, being informed on the local ecosystem for explaining on the Podcast, and we will make some ancillary social media posts & content to give some insight to the BCH community that can't make it but it won't be a full stream.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous 5 Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a new page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. If funding stops I will eventually have to work harder on alternative monetisation strategies (possibly advertising, sponsored episodes) though.
