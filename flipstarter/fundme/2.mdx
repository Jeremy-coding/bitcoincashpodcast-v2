# Flipstarter: Episodes 136 - 145 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 18 BCH (~$600 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 136 - 145. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

## Notes

### FundMe

Previous campaign was a successful transition to FundMe, happy to be back on the platform. Thanks again to Sayoshi. Progress is clear on having a convenient central point to assess desired community needs plus a record of past fundraises. I think a great future innovation would be some kind of Patreon-style subscription payments where users could load a balance one time and have it distribute to chosen creators on a recurring basis with the ability to revoke their subscription to any creator if delivery wasn't matching expectations. I'm sure we'll get there.

### Visibility

There's a number of facts contributing to the slow & steady continuing increase of Podcast reach (now approaching 10k Twitter followers & 2.5k Youtube subscribers).

The traction of major projects, particularly with the rising amount of BCH DeFi, is growing. BCH Bull & Cauldron are stand outs in this regard.

Price is rising in USD terms while holding steady or even creeping up slightly in BTC terms. As ever, this is fantastic for our global & crypto industry mindshare.

BCH is dead FUD has essentially died (once again) & is now being followed by a fresh round of "maybe the bcashers were right?"  This is no doubt also feeding into a general rise in visibility of the Podcast. We'll be winning over converts that contribute to the next round of hushed whispers that lead to increased visibility & more "bCaSH is DeAd, I CaN KeEp iGnOrInG It!" cope.

## Badgers.cash

I discovered that BADGER token, obtainable only by provably time-locking BCH on-chain, has traded as high as #10 on Cauldron. Speculative liquidity thus created a **native BCH yield** for time-locking BCH. This is an incredible community innovation, as it allows anyone to yield on their BCH by provably HODLing (boosting price, liquidity & thus marketing reach) and it also allows anyone to generate goodwill in the community by provably purchasing & burning BADGER. It's always been possible to "donate" to all BCH holders by burning BCH itself, but that's psychologically unappealing due to the limited supply of BCH. BADGER avoids that, is fun, generates more transactions & usage of CashTokens tech.

In order to boost Badger TVL, what is needed is some kind of non-speculative demand to buy (& ideally burn) BADGER tokens. My idea for this is that community projects can show goodwill to the community by provably burning & I'm going to start with the Podcast. As an experiment, 2.7% (0.5 BCH) of the desired raised funds will be used to purchase Badger on Cauldron.quest and provably burn it. Readers are more than welcome to frontrun this by purchasing BADGER, which achieves somewhat the same effect! If this caught on as a community initiative by aligned projects, it would encourage more people to lock BCH, boosting the price and bringing more resources to the community to run even more projects (which can burn more BADGER). Raising BCH on-chain TVL is one of the few ways to defeat naked short selling, Tether inflation or other manipulation of the BCH price so I am very interested in new & potentially compelling ways to encourage this.

We'll see if funders are enthusiastic about this experiment &/or if Badger TVL continues to grow. If it does, maybe I'll continue it as a regular part of the Flipstarter. As of time of writing (Monday 9th December 2024), Badger has 65 BCH TVL in 44 locks & BADGER is $0.0091 with $731 TVL & $1288 30d volume.

## Note to the community

Along with The BCH Podcast & General Protocol's Spaces, a big shoutout to Paul for his continuing great work on his Youtube channel & also Fiendish for his new Fiendish & Friends weekly Space which is very promising.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous FundMe + 5x Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a dedicated page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

## Cost breakdown:

- 0.1 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.1 BCH Youtube Shorts creation & distribution
- 0.1 BCH Instagram & TikTok videos & management

1.6 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 16 BCH

0.5 BCH: BADGER burn.
1 BCH misc expenses: Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, Zoom subscription, supporting other community fundraisers, FAQ maintenance etc.
0.5 BCH: Fundme.cash fee

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. If funding stops I will eventually have to work harder on alternative monetisation strategies (possibly advertising, sponsored episodes) though.
