# FundMe: Episodes 176 - 185 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 28.5 BCH (~$562 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 176 - 185. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.
- Weekly BCH Bullet newsletter on Sundays during the delivery period of the episodes.

## Notes

### FundMe

The Podcast is now located in its own studio! This is part of an effort to increase the professionalism of the broadcast, with improved cameras, lightning & set design. Further improvements to come on this front but viewers should already note the initial changes on stream. A dedicated workspace has also helped in the focus & output of the Podcast generally. Of course, more space & equipment itself requires more investment - but BCH can't grow with media production done from bedrooms forever. In other news, BLAZE is underway & the Podcast has been thrilled to help with that initiative. Materials from BLAZE can be archived for future developers joining the ecosystem & it's giving BCH a strong outwards impression to new builders and industry competitors alike.

### Visibility

The Podcast has grown another 10% on Youtube since the last FundMe, now reaching 3.36k subs.  It is still rate limited on Twitter, every time it hits 9 990 followers it then "mysteriously" loses 50 or so followers - as has been the case for many months at this point. Even large visibility from discussion around Epstein and Who Killed Bitcoin related commentary apparently did not gain any new followers (curious!).

Regardless, The BCH Bullet is still growing and has nearly doubled in size to 49 subscribers and 300 Twitter followers. That's really nice to see our expanding reach.

Although it is not specifically a Podcast initiative, my hope is that BCH can also work around algorithmic suppression on Twitter with BChat from Selene. Between that and growing interest from outsiders maybe we can break through to the next level of reach.

## Note to the community

2026 has started well for the BCH community, rising in price while the market falls apart for competitors. Epstein papers have also created huge interest in the Hijacking, which is increasing interest in BCH as a byproduct.

Very excited for Layla to go live in May at BLISS! Looking forward to meeting new Podcast listeners in person and catching up with some regulars!

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous 5x FundMes + 5x Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a dedicated page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

## Cost breakdown:

- 0.5 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 0.5 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.1 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.15 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.15 BCH Youtube Shorts creation & distribution

1.4 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 14 BCH

- 0.2 BCH per BCH Bullet
x12 Bullets = 2.4 BCH

6 BCH: Studio rent.
2 BCH: Accounting costs.
2 BCH: Additional media on-site help for livestream coverage at BLISS.
2 BCH misc expenses: Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, supporting other community fundraisers, FAQ maintenance etc.
0.1 BCH: Fundme.cash fee

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason.

## Badgers.cash

No Badgers burning like on previous FundMes. I was hoping to make this kind of community incentive for proof-of-HODL to gain extra traction but it doesn't seem very in demand. I still like the concept, but have to listen to the feedback of the market.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the FundMe gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous FundMe, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. The community contributions do a lot to help the show operate in the community's best interest without compromising for financial necessity.
