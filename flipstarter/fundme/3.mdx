# Flipstarter: Episodes 146 - 155 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 45 BCH (~$320 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 146 - 155. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

## Notes

### FundMe

Very happy to be doing my third FundMe campaign. All the previous campaigns have gone really smoothly with the help of this tool. And if the early work on OpenCashDAO (https://github.com/OpenCashDAO) is any indication, maybe in a few months we'll have even more advanced funding tools!

### Visibility

Podcast visibility & clout continues to rise. 

## Badgers.cash

My last round of buring BADGER was a really fun experiment, so I have allocated some funds in the FundMe to once again do a provable burn. Haven't managed to make this a community meme yet, but it's not been a big focus.

-- Explanation of Badgers below

I discovered that BADGER token, obtainable only by provably time-locking BCH on-chain, has traded as high as #10 on Cauldron. Speculative liquidity thus created a **native BCH yield** for time-locking BCH. This is an incredible community innovation, as it allows anyone to yield on their BCH by provably HODLing (boosting price, liquidity & thus marketing reach) and it also allows anyone to generate goodwill in the community by provably purchasing & burning BADGER. It's always been possible to "donate" to all BCH holders by burning BCH itself, but that's psychologically unappealing due to the limited supply of BCH. BADGER avoids that, is fun, generates more transactions & usage of CashTokens tech.

In order to boost Badger TVL, what is needed is some kind of non-speculative demand to buy (& ideally burn) BADGER tokens. My idea for this is that community projects can show goodwill to the community by provably burning & I'm going to start with the Podcast. As an experiment, 2.7% (0.5 BCH) of the desired raised funds will be used to purchase Badger on Cauldron.quest and provably burn it. Readers are more than welcome to frontrun this by purchasing BADGER, which achieves somewhat the same effect! If this caught on as a community initiative by aligned projects, it would encourage more people to lock BCH, boosting the price and bringing more resources to the community to run even more projects (which can burn more BADGER). Raising BCH on-chain TVL is one of the few ways to defeat naked short selling, Tether inflation or other manipulation of the BCH price so I am very interested in new & potentially compelling ways to encourage this.

## Note to the community

A huge thank you from me to The Bitcoin Cash Foundation, Casual BCH, General Protocol's Spaces, Paul, Fiendish & Friends and everyone else doing great work promoting BCH! It really truly is a team effort & I love having so much regular BCH content to consume beyond my own show.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous 2x FundMes + 5x Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a dedicated page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

## Cost breakdown:

- 1.1 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 1.1 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.3 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.3 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.3 BCH Youtube Shorts creation & distribution
- 0.2 BCH Instagram & TikTok videos & management

3.3 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 33 BCH

1 BCH: BADGER burn.
5 BCH: Accounting costs.
5 BCH misc expenses: Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, Zoom subscription, supporting other community fundraisers, FAQ maintenance etc.
1 BCH: Fundme.cash fee

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. If funding stops I will eventually have to work harder on alternative monetisation strategies (possibly advertising, sponsored episodes) though.
