# FundMe: Episodes 156 - 165 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 29 BCH (~$~ / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 166 - 175. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.
- Weekly BCH Bullet newsletter on Sundays during the delivery period of the episodes.

## Notes

### FundMe

The Podcast is now located in its own studio! This is part of an effort to increase the professionalism of the broadcast, with improved cameras, lightning & set design. Further improvements to come on this front but viewers should already note the initial changes on stream. A dedicated workspace has also helped in the focus & output of the Podcast generally. Of course, more space & equipment itself requires more investment - but BCH can't grow with media production done from bedrooms forever. In other news, BLAZE is underway & the Podcast has been thrilled to help with that initiative. Materials from BLAZE can be archived for future developers joining the ecosystem & it's giving BCH a strong outwards impression to new builders and industry competitors alike.

### Visibility

The Podcast has now passed 3 000 Youtube subscribers, and appears rate limited by Twitter somehow on its final precipe before 10 000 Twitter followers. Nevertheless, the Podcast has innovated around these visibility limits by introducing The BCH Bullet, now with 29 Substack subscribers and 165 Twitter followers but already pulling in 1.5-4k views per tweet! The Bullet has delivered 13 weekly columns to date to enthusiastic community interest, validating its concept & making it a suitable include in the offerings of the Podcast to the BCH FundMe community.

## Note to the community

The final stretch of November/December for 2025 is upon us. Layla is locking in, BCH is increasingly shining in a market where BTC is embroiled in pointless infighting, most alternatives seem to be just scams or trapped in circular techno""innovating"" & both digital cash & privacy are beginning to receive recognition and interest. Feels like 2026 might be the BCH break out year, and we can set us ourselves up with a strong finish in 2025.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.

## Badgers.cash

Badgers has been a strong success, and since the last FundMe has grown its TVL yet another 33% to now over 400 BCH TVL (!!!), with very minimal marketing & ongoing tech support. I really enjoy contributing to it with the Podcast FundMe raises as Proof of Community good will & I am still trying to encourage other ecosystem players to consider doing this too.

-- Explanation of Badgers below

I discovered that BADGER token, obtainable only by provably time-locking BCH on-chain, has traded as high as #10 on Cauldron. Speculative liquidity thus created a **native BCH yield** for time-locking BCH. This is an incredible community innovation, as it allows anyone to yield on their BCH by provably HODLing (boosting price, liquidity & thus marketing reach) and it also allows anyone to generate goodwill in the community by provably purchasing & burning BADGER. It's always been possible to "donate" to all BCH holders by burning BCH itself, but that's psychologically unappealing due to the limited supply of BCH. BADGER avoids that, is fun, generates more transactions & usage of CashTokens tech.

In order to boost Badger TVL, what is needed is some kind of non-speculative demand to buy (& ideally burn) BADGER tokens. My idea for this is that community projects can show goodwill to the community by provably burning & I'm going to start with the Podcast. As a part of this ongoing experiment, some of the desired raised funds will be used to purchase Badger on Cauldron.quest and provably burn it. Readers are more than welcome to frontrun this by purchasing BADGER, which achieves somewhat the same effect! If this caught on as a community initiative by aligned projects, it would encourage more people to lock BCH, boosting the price and bringing more resources to the community to run even more projects (which can burn more BADGER). Raising BCH on-chain TVL is one of the few ways to defeat naked short selling, Tether inflation or other manipulation of the BCH price so I am very interested in new & potentially compelling ways to encourage this.

## Disclaimer

I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the FundMe gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous FundMe, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. The community contributions do a lot to help the show operate in the community's best interest without compromising for financial necessity.
