# Flipstarter: Episodes 106 - 115 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 24 BCH (~$270 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 106 - 115. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.

**NOTE:** I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard. If funding stops I will eventually have to work harder on alternative monetisation strategies (possibly advertising, sponsored episodes) though.

## Notes

### Proof of Work

I have aggregated previous delivery & community work (including previous 3 Flipstarter delivery & accountability) on a new page on the Bitcoin Cash Podcast website. See it here: [https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/proof-of-work).

### Impact

The Podcast continues to grow slowly on all visibility metrics. I have started new [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebchpodcast/) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thebchpodcast) feeds (follow us!) with regular videos to spread onto further platforms. The latest episode #107 discussing Eric Wall also got his attention enough to [repost for an additional 5k views](https://twitter.com/TheBCHPodcast/status/1754248435656782179) & is a clear sign BCH is beginning to break into the "crypto mainstream".

### A Fifth Of Gaming

On the previous Flipstarter I experimented with introducing budget for helping out other BCH teams starting with A Fifth Of Gaming. This wasn't as impactful as I'd hope. I am already overstretched with my other contributions in the ecosystem & wasn't able to give AFoG the attention I'd hoped. Furthermore, the AFoG team is doing a great job on improving the site but did not have marketing outreach as one of its own internal priorities during the same time window so the effect was diluted.

I did run the Starcraft tournaments but did not get much participation (needed more time to embed & promote within the SC2 community which I did not have). I will still have this on my radar, but truthfully I just didn't put enough focus on it to get results. I take this as a learning experience & this time my deliverable is just the Podcast episodes as before with other ecosystem contributions being a bonus.

## Cost breakdown:

- 0.75 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 0.75 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.1 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.1 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.1 BCH Youtube Shorts creation & distribution
- 0.2 BCH Instagram & TikTok videos & management

2 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 20 BCH

4 BCH misc expenses: Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, Zoom subscription.

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason. Missed out on shoutouts in the 2 already delivered episode, but I'm sure faster delivery is preferable anyway.

## Note to the community

I feel like BCH has hit the ground running in 2024. Many projects are beginning to really find their footing & network effect is observably starting to snowball in on-chain metrics. I'd love it if we can be more data driven in the future & that's something I will be adding some momentum to as and when I have spare bandwidth for it.  In the meantime, [AnyHedge on DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/anyhedge?denomination=BCH) & the upcoming BCH Guru dashboards are exactly the kind of innovations the community should be supporting.

BLISS is coming up in May & I'm excited to see everyone there! To find out more, check out [the BLISS website](https://www.bliss.cash/) and if you need help to buy a Jessica NFT ticket then [watch my guide on buying a ticket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzbIJ6pDV8E).

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.
