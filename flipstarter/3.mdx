# Flipstarter: Episodes 96 - 105 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 35 BCH (~$245 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 96 - 105. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.
- Running AFoG Power Overwhelming SC2 guild

**NOTE:** I will be completing the deliverables whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show & my assistance to the community is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard.

## Previous Flipstarters

2x Flipstarters for Episodes 76 to 95 were 100% delivered as promised.

A Shadow Wizards stream was also done although getting it published is still on the TODO list, more possible on this front after that.
- Founding & ongoing contributions to [Selene Wallet](https://selene.cash). This has its own Flipstarters & other contributors, I'm not trying to double-dip on credibility, but I mention it here to underscore how much of my time & effort goes into BCH projects.

## Cost breakdown:

35 BCH Total

### Podcast Episodes

Budget has increased here slightly in reflection of the ongoing reach of The Podcast, as visible in the [stats](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/stats) & also in the increasing narrative influence of the show. We are beginning to really make inroads in the general crypto narrative, a good specific example is the way Paul Sztorc (after [appearing on the show](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/episodes/89) and subsequent Twitter debate) has become very concerned that Lightning Network is failing the BTC community & the BCH community are a real threat. See [here](https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1719119255952585164) and [here](https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1719388665107947959). We're really starting to upset the apple cart with how visible our growing momentum is.

- 0.7 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 0.5 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.1 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.1 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.1 BCH Clips creation & distribution

1.5 BCH / episode
x10 episodes = 15 BCH

### AFoG Power Overwhelming Guild

The BCH Community has been crushing it recently with a lot of exciting projects appearing or making huge strides forward. Among them, A Fifth of Gaming is one of the innovations I am personally MOST excited about. There's a few reasons:

- The gaming industry is absolutely huge. AFoG perfectly targets a younger, tech savvy demographic with a real use case that CANNOT be replicated by fiat and not even most crypto competitors. The overlap with streaming culture is also very significant, making the viral potential very high.
- It's a perfect way to onboard new users & teach them about non-custodial p2p cash as an enabler for something they're already motivated to engage with (games they already like to play).
- Previous Power Overwhelming tournaments have been fun & well received. Small so far, but with a good combination of recurring & new players. There has been very few bugs & tons of feedback generated to improve the experience going forward.
- David has been crushing it with updates & development, take a look at the extremely thorough [October dev blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/afog/comments/17lf78z/dev_blog_2_oct_2023/).

All of these factors made me very excited to start running the Power Overwhelming Starcraft 2 guild as part of the beta, paving the way for others to run similar competitive guilds for other games in the upcoming full release. I think the potential & rate of improvement here are amazing, so I've added ongoing support for this Guild as a new Flipstarter deliverable. I'm excited to see what I can do to help this BCH project grow & succeed.

The organisational overhead of running the tournaments themselves is very low (AFoG itself handles most of that), but there is a lot of surrounding work in generating interest, making content (such as the [Finals stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfZtHSHNTPc)), reporting feedback, testing new features. In addition, funds are required for sponsoring the Guild - which advertises the Podcast itself, plus adds to the prize pool of each tournament creating additional incentive for players to compete.

So far: We've had 3 tournaments featuring 8 unique players. I am hopeful we can grow this number substantially going forward.

If you play Starcraft (or would like to try, it's free!), check out [the Guild on AFoG](https://afifthofgaming.com/Guild/Detail/18) & join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/AFoG_PowerOverwhelming). Tournaments run every 5 days, so there's one always coming up shortly.

For more context on this see [Episode 94 with AFoG’s creator David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yadskoNfbwI) and the [inaugural Power Overwhelming finals stream of myself vs Kallisti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfZtHSHNTPc). 

- 2 BCH Guild sponsorship
- 5 BCH Admin overhead & tournament promotion

### Additional Projects

As should be clear from the Previous Flipstarter & Other prior Track Record sections, I spend a lot of time on Bitcoin Cash - well over the specific deliverables of the Flipstarters themselves. Perhaps as a response to this, previous Flipstarters received feedback that I should raise the ask quite significantly. Apparently lots of people wanted to send in sats & fund my various work promoting BCH who simply did not have time to see or contribute before the Flipstarter was already filled.

I have a huge list of ideas for various things I want to create or support in the BCH community. I don't want to make any specific promises or deliverables from these because it can be sporadic what gets worked on and when it gets delivered, but you can be sure I am constantly dedicating time to such endeavours & they often happen under the radar for a while before appearing in public.

It is my ambition to eventually be able to work on Bitcoin Cash / The Podcast full time & this section is an initial experiment in moving towards that being a realistic possibility (it would need to replace my salary as a JavaScript programmer). I am very open to discussing with Flipstarter contributors privately if they have specific questions about where this money is going, but the gist of it is I'm hoping that my output is enough to justify some discretionary funds without a specific deliverable attached.

- 10 BCH various projects & community contributions - running / expanding Shadow Wizards Twitter, contributing to other project's Flipstarters, ongoing BCH advocacy podcast guest appearances where invited, music / video production, private alpha/beta testing BCH apps & other similar activities.

### Miscellaneous

- 3 BCH Ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, Zoom subscription.

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason. Missed out on shoutouts in the 1 already delivered episode, but I'm sure faster delivery is preferable anyway.

## Note to the community

The Bitcoin Cash community is truly beginning to thrive. Ongoing improvements in wallets & infrastructure is now occurring concurrently with a growing ecosystem around CashTokens & a burgeoning set of new apps & projects (AFoG, CashNinjas, Cauldron Quest to name a few). The community is harmonious & working hard. We're really beginning to ruffle feathers outside of our default circle (particularly in BTC) & the more we increase our lead no doubt the further this will compound. Very exciting to finish the year strong & carry momentum forward into 2024.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.
