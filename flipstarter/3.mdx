# Flipstarter: Episodes 96 - 105 of The Bitcoin Cash Podcast

### Funding requested: 25 BCH (~$250 / BCH)

## Deliverable

- Episodes 96 - 105. The same show you already know and (hopefully) love.
- ~~ Ongoing contributions to the BCH community (see notes below).

**NOTE:** I will be completing the rest of the episodes whether or not the Flipstarter gets funded, the continuation of the show is in no way contingent on this funding request. However, as per previous Flipstarter, I believe this is a valuable community service & get a lot of feedback in that regard.

## Previous Flipstarters

Maybe more to come with this if the time can be found.
- Founding & ongoing contributions to [Selene Wallet](https://selene.cash). This has its own Flipstarters & other contributors, I'm not trying to double-dip on credibility, but I mention it here to underscore how much of my time & effort goes into BCH projects.

## Cost breakdown:

0.9 BCH / episode

- 0.3 BCH topic research, episode hosting
- 0.3 BCH production & editing costs
- 0.1 BCH Thumbnail graphics & episode distribution
- 0.1 BCH Timestamps, links & episode summary
- 0.1 BCH Clips creation & distribution

x10 episodes = 9 BCH

+3 BCH miscellaneous ongoing costs such as website hosting & domain registration, accounting, Zoom subscription, promotional CashRains.

Budget has increased slightly in fiat terms compared to previous Flipstarter, all in the miscellaneous costs. Previous Flipstarter was so successful & immediately filled that I have moved the bar up a touch higher. This should reflect ongoing improvement of the show & positive feedback from the community.

## Contributor rewards:

Donations of > 0.5 BCH will receive a shoutout at the end of each show (like the Patrons and Sponsors) unless your name/message is rude or slanderous or you ask me not to or it's otherwise unreadable for some reason. Missed out on shoutouts in the 3 already delivered episodes, but I'm sure faster delivery is preferable anyway.

## Note to the community

Congratulations on the recent price increases which has led to increased visibility & exposure for The Bitcoin Cash Podcast & many others in the ecosystem. This impact can be seen in [growth of the statistics](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/stats). Among others, many BCH promoting accounts on "X" (formerly: Twitter), a bastion of broader crypto discussion, have been seeing a lot of rising, organic traction.

I have strong belief that this rise is a reward for the relentless, valuable work the entire ecosystem has been doing & I hope it can begin an on-going upward spiral of increased price > increased exposure > increased BCH economic activity > increased price as per Bitcoin's economic model.

Let's keep building Bitcoin Cash.
